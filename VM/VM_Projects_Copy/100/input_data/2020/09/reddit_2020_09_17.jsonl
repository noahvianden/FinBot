I had some savings left and everyone was telling me don't do it, don't invest anywhere and I felt saving accounts weren't giving me anything. So started doing research because at that time AMD had been in a lawsuit for anti-competitiveness with Intel paying manufacturers to use their product over AMD( I think the settlement was like $4 billion) but don't recall. When the crash happened they tumbled along with a couple of other ones, like Sony and Microsoft. So during the crash I had picked up AMD (my starting costs were at 1.25 or 1.26, if i recall correctly). Then I started buying more as i started working during school. Later on my research found that they were being used in gaming systems. So I decided to start buying more and at ~~one~~ my highest point, I had like 40k shares, but now wish I had held on to it all. With that being said, I started buying more AMD during 2009 to 2015, I also started buying SNE (15-17/share) and MSFT around 22/share but sold them off. But i had a feeling that they would be coming back up because their core business is not really consumer as it is innovation and businesses. An example is Sony camera's are in most smart phones. \n\nSo some of it was luck and some of it was understand and predicting that their business model will pay off because I like to always invest for the long run, and don't care much for the short-term.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the insightful reply!

We as a human driver, have the ability to mitigate these issues with windshield wipers, defrosting functions, moving your head into another position to see clearly, etc. I think the cameras either need to be doubled up for redundancy or they need to add methods to clear the view. Either heated lenses, wipers or some other method of keeping the view as clear as possible. Then all these arguments can just fuck right off. \n\nThe only other thing humans have as an advantage is the brain's ability to perceive things that aren't totally visible. We can also just make decisions on blind faith/knowledge that something should be a certain way or a previous experience in a certain situation to make a call that a beginner driver would fail to make correctly.\n\nHopefully machine learning and AI will overcome these things. For example, a self teaching AI could observe a driver correction in a tricky intersection and make note of it for the next time it has to navigate that intersection.\n\nAlso, infrastructure will ultimately play a big role in making FSD work for all vehicles. Traffic flow systems should have wireless beacons to tell vehicles what it's doing (this could be cheap and easy to implement). Construction crews could have beacons in their safety equipment to let the cars know there's construction and extra obstacles to be aware of.

No one is better equipped to supply nickel to Tesla than $VALE. During Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, Elon [painstakingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s) laid out how badly they were looking for a nickel producer.\n\n“Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some long — some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.”\n\n**>>>THE STARS ALIGNED<<<**\n\nThe following points are largely circumstantial evidence, however when stacked together create an extremely powerful narrative and points toward the extreme likelihood of $VALE actually having lined up a *revolutionary* deal with Tesla.\n\n**Quotes from Tesla Q2 2020 Earnings Call**\n\n“There’s so much to be excited about. It’s really hard to kind of fit into this call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing/engineering front is mind-blowing. And then of course there’s Battery Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I think that’s really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.”-Elon Musk\n\n“Yeah. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That’s the real limit. So that’s where — we’re going to talk about — a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell level will be a limiting factor. So whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining — there’s many steps from refining to cathode and anode, cell formation. Whatever the choke point is, that will set the growth rate. And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others, and there’s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.”-Elon Musk\n\n“Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some long — some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever.

So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.”-Elon Musk\n\n“Like the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we’re all making progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress. So yeah, we need to not go bankrupt, obviously. That’s important, because then we’ll fail in our mission. But we’re not trying to be super profitable either, obviously, profitability is like 1% or something, just 1% or 2%. It’s not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth, and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that’s what we’re trying to achieve.”-Elon Musk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Battery Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/1hflvjl37wn51.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=44dfdec411edbfe6403baff75428a2954d03f907)\n\n[Battery Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/c7y5dnf6qpn51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad56c9de0e857425b200fe5be9a57456dabb22e)\n\n**Philippe Houchois — Jefferies — Analyst**\n\n“Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. You mentioned a few times about the constraint to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you’re building right now. Will there be — the battery capacity consistent with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Will you have to import batteries from outside Europe to ensure production in Berlin?\n\nElon Musk — Chief Executive Officer\n\nOkay. We can’t say too much about this, except that there will be local cell production, and that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory.

Electric vehicles and other modern technology NEED nickel to function.\n\n“With demand expected to increase from 2.2 million metric tons to somewhere in the range of 3.5 million to 4.0 million metric tons by 2030, the nickel market could become constrained.”-McKinsey and Company By Marcelo Azevedo, Nicolas Goffaux, and Ken Hoffman\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nickel Demand](https://preview.redd.it/wm8sxvb97wn51.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfdccf6ba7eb7d7e666c08818ef21ae19198d9e9)\n\n[Nickel Demand](https://preview.redd.it/4rzkxjo9qpn51.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=707261054c866c517f142037bf90f46d2bdc91fe)\n\n**Elon Musk’s Emphasis on “Environmentally Friendly”**\n\nDuring the call and clip that was hyperlinked above, Elon emphasizes the demand for an “environmentally friendly” mine. Historically, we all know mines have run into trouble with being friendly toward the environment. Today more than ever, a company's concern for the environment must be vocally expressed and physically acknowledged. If not, the reporters and media will bash Tesla for not being environmentally sensitive. Elon Musk understands this and is aware that the nickel company Tesla chooses must at least appear as if they are environmentally “sensitive\". Vale’s website has information on how they are [sustainable](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/annual-reports/sustainability-reports/Sustainability%20Reports/Relatorio_sustentabilidade_vale_2019_alta_en.pdf) and [conscious](http://www.vale.com/esg/en/Pages/Home.aspx) of the controversies surrounding the mining industry.\n\n“Given Tesla’s focus on sustainability, the company is likely to prefer to buy from miners of higher-grade nickel sulphide, which requires less power to process than laterite ore, said Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank.”-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton“There are three key suppliers - Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA, which operates in Canada using some hydropower, Russia's Norilsk Nickel GMKN.MM and BHP Group's operations BHP.AX in Western Australia. **\"**[**Vale**](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/please-mine-more-nickel-musk-urges-as-tesla-boosts-production-2020-07-23) **is in the box seat,\"** he said.”-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton\n\nJust the appearance and attempt to be environmental is enough to scare away most journalists who are looking to make a hit piece on Tesla.

Tesla and Vale have already signed a confidential contract in regards to Tesla’s battery composition materials needed.\n\nIn 2019, Tesla hired an Engineer from Vale-NC to “facilitate procurement and familiarization with the products of the Caledonian plant”\n\n\"Tesla has recruited an engineer in a nickel-cobalt refinery in New Caledonia, that of Vale, in order to facilitate purchases for its large European electric vehicle factory in Berlin.\"\n\n**Vale using Tesla’s Lithium batteries at Guaiba iron ore port**\n\n“Iron ore miner Vale is installing a Tesla battery energy storage system at Ilha Guaiba terminal in Rio de Janeiro state to help meet power needs at the port as it moves toward energy saving technology.”[\\-London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/082520-miner-vale-to-use-tesla-lithium-batteries-at-guaiba-iron-ore-port)“\n\nThe project will substitute 20% of the facility's power costs using Tesla manufactured lithium-ion batteries with technology contributing to decarbonization plans, Vale said in an Aug. 24 statement.”[\\-London](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/082520-miner-vale-to-use-tesla-lithium-batteries-at-guaiba-iron-ore-port)\n\n**Tesla’s technology is being used to lower costs at Vale’s iron ore** and to contribute to the “decarbonization plans”.

In my view, most Tesla commentary continues to overlook what is already known when it comes to predictions for what will be revealed on Tesla Battery Day.\nUpdate: Elon Musk has responded to this article:\n\nWhile there will no doubt be exciting showcase technology and plenty of “one more thing” elements, Elon Musk has probably already revealed the main battery tech that will enable Tesla to massively scale its mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy (and transport).\nI analysed and explained my take on this news immediately after it broke during the Tesla 2020 Q2 earning call in July, but it seems a significant portion of Tesla chatter has simply missed it or, more likely, not understood it.\nNot everyone knows that LFP battery packs are at least 20% cheaper per kWh than nickel-based battery packs, and that LFP cathodes have no mineral supply constraints or price spikes (unlike nickel cells). But when you do know that, and if you heard what Elon said, it adds up to something very significant.\n\nWhat did Elon say?\n\nSo let’s break it down once more. Here is what Elon already said in the Q2 call for those who didn’t catch it the first time around (this time with italics):\n“The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at an affordable price, that’s the real limit, so that’s why we’re going to talk a lot more about this on battery day, because this is the fundamental scaling constraint.”\n“There’s two general classes of cell, there’s iron phosphate [LFP] and then the nickel based. Nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer range obviously those are needed for something like the Semi where every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo. So it’s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack.\n“However, what we’re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough that we actually are comfortable having an LFP pack in Model 3 in China, and that will be in volume production later this year. So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200s… you probably get a range of almost 300 miles, with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies.” Elon Musk, 2020 Q2 Tesla earnings call.\n\nI have written about the economics and properties of LFP cells and nickel-cobalt cells for electric vehicles several times (check here, here, and here), so maybe I have a different perspective from most Tesla watchers. The interpretation of Elon Musk’s statements seems unambiguous to me. But even simple words are open to different interpretations, so I’ll spell out my interpretation here:\nThere are lots of varieties of electrochemistry, but currently there are only two main commercial pathways for EV cells, LFP (iron phosphate–based cathodes) and nickel (nickel cobalt–based cathodes). This is widely understood within the industry. So far, so good.\nThe higher energy density of nickel-cobalt cells (compared to LFP) is well suited to long-range, weight-sensitive electric vehicles like the Tesla Semi. However (in contrast) for Tesla passenger vehicles (especially the entry level vehicles not needing 400+ miles of range, or crazy power-to-weight performance ratios), Tesla’s many years of accumulating powertrain and other efficiencies mean that even the more modest energy density of LFP is now sufficient to give almost 300 miles of range.\nAdd in the crucial side note (that Elon knows very well but most of the Tesla community apparently does not) that LFP EV batteries are much cheaper per kWh and much more scalable (raw material availability) than nickel ones.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, in the long term future, we will be looking at more performant battery technology, but Tesla is selling more Model 3s than they have the batteries to keep up with, so at least until the next generation they will continue needing a large amount of nickel and iron. \n\nYou are focusing on the 5-10 year outlook, while this post is focusing on the near term.

{"title": "Sell Facebook from all long term holdings, they are on a decline, VR won't save them.", "selftext": "Of all the tech stocks that are down today, FB is down the most. This confirms that big funds are rebalancing, they are cutting stocks that they think will yield shittier returns in the future. Also confirms my belief about Facebook on a decline, with the whole Social Dilemma, it shines a light on their corrupt evil ways, the users are increasingly aware of it.\n\nTikTok has Zuck shook, a tiny app originally from China almost dethroned FB, he had to resort to lobbying Trump to get rid of it. Long term, FB is running out of places to expand, they can't in China for obvious reasons, which is arguably the biggest and most profitable market. So they resorted to South East Asian countries, but the problem is their middle class is almost none existent, and FB coming in have caused mass civil unrest... their users LITERALLY killing each other off, not good for business. They are DESPERATELY trying to branch out by investing heavy in AI and VR, VR has very little demand right now, mostly a fad until it can achieve insane resolutions, and frankly it's risky and probably won't pay off in the near/medium term. Their AI department cannot compete with Google or Tesla, I think the big boys realize this, that's why they are dumping it the most. Either way, I would not long FB in any of my long term portfolios. Twitter is a much better bet, they are essentially becoming an utility at this point.\n\nTheir domestic market is becoming stale, with China on the rise, having zero access to their market is a huge downside. What's left for them to expand? Africa? Idk much about them, but I'm pretty sure China has first dibs on their market, WeChat will most likely be the social media app of Africa.\n\nYou gotta ask yourself, where is FB going to find growth? Take a look at Apple, they penetrated pretty much every market on earth, and their devices are becoming less and less appealing with each iteration. They need a breakthrough in hardware technology to get on the next wave, therefore, their only move is services, it took them 10 fucking years to realize this... they need to squeeze more dollars from their existing customers instead of finding new users. Facebook doesn't have that luxury, it doesn't have the cult following Apple has, Apple has a much stronger moat than Facebook, because while Facebook has network effects on its side, it will also be its downfall. Network effects can work negatively too, when another app becomes popular, it uses network effects to growth exponentially, and FB's market share will shrink exponentially. Its the reason why some social media platforms rise as quickly as they die, MySpace, YikYak, Tumblr. How much more fucking advertisement can they stuff down your throat? How many more dollars can they squeeze from their data that is starting to lack diversity? How much more is their data gonna be worth by recording your 1020023rd like on the latest Instagram Thot's 5226th ass picture?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Facebook's reigning days are numbered, they are on a decline, no more exponential growth.

However, the reality is, VR will continue to only be popular with enthusiasts for the next couple of years or so. MagicLeap, Vive, Steam are all pouring in money into Spatial Computing development in order to be attractive to enterprises but in its current state VR remains janky and will continue to be this way until they make MAJOR hardware breakthroughs (figuring out near consistent zero latency wireless streaming, better mapping, and better device packaging, among others) \n\n2: Letting the Right Wing make FB its battleground: In USA, India, Brazil, Phillipines, etc FB has essentially picked its side. This is especially apparent in India where a population of 1.3bn that’s spirited by the ruling hindu majoritarians government’s populist and divisionary ideology is turning more radical by the day because of fake news that’s circulated by the bots on primarily Facebook and Whatsapp. All of this is absolutely unchecked, and even the head of FB in India is openly supportive of the present political establishment. Leaders belonging to this party are allowed to run their mouth and openly call for persecution of the minorities without their accounts being suspended EVER. \nBy entrenching itself with populist leaders, especially in population dense countries, facebook is ensuring that its users continue to engage on its platforms.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Couldn’t have said it better myself.

They have no real competitor doing exactly the same thing. Even most people that don’t like Facebook continue to use it out of fear of missing out. A large segment of the population considers Facebook to be a news source (insane, but true). \n\nI agree with your logic. But Facebook itself has shown that people are not logical. People aren’t leaving in droves, even as it’s been made clear they are a dangerous platform. \n\nThere are still several ways Facebook could more effectively monetize itself, which it hasn’t figured out yet.
