The price of TSLA plummeted right after the market closed on Friday, because the S&P 500 announced that it would not be including TSLA as anticipated.

Everyone looks at option chain quotes, and some of the realtime data in there, like the greeks and IV, come from a pricing model calculations. I'm not sure if its the broker doing it or the exchange, but the market \"knows\" to the extent that they pay attention to that realtime option chain quote data.\n\n> How do you know if that is the correct value or not ?\n\nCorrect according to what? This is actually a profound epistemological question, but rather than go down that rabbit hole, let's simply assert that the market is almost always correct (efficient market theory), except when it isn't.\n\nBTW, \"trading at $7\" is not well-defined. Is that the last trade? The bid? The ask? The mid of the bid/ask? Let's say it's the last trade that happened 1 second ago. If we look at the full order book, we see bids ranging from $6.99 down to $0.06. Which of those is \"correct\"? Somebody thinks that SPY is going to tank and will only pay $0.06 for that ITM contract. Now, most of us would say that guy is delusional, but can we categorically say he is wrong?

IV is sort of the \"fudge factor\" in pricing models. You can think of IV as a proxy for uncertainty. For example, the more time there is to expiration, the more uncertain the final price will be. IV expresses some of that uncertainty.\n\nBut IV doesn't mean the *market* is incorrect/inefficient. IV is *derived from* what the market is doing.

I almost never go above 60 days to expiration, you are a bit above that. The further out you go, the more you pay in premium, so you paid more than you had to.\n\nHowever, since the expiration is so far out, you have plenty of time to make a decision. Decide on a profit target, a loss target, and a maximum holding time. Stick to that exit strategy and you'll be fine.\n\nTo get out of the position, just close it. Ideally for more money than you paid for it, so that you make a profit. Don't confuse selling to open (your $33 strike example) with sell to close. You only want to sell to close\n\nThere are tons of guides and explainers at the top of the page that can help you with all this.

My profit target hopefully is when it hits $39 ish.\n\nYou'll find it easier to define the target as a % return on premium. So if your profit exit target is 10%, and you opened for $1.00 premium, you would close when the premium was at $1.10 or higher. It's harder to base exit strategies on underlying price, since the translation to premium price is complicated and non-linear.

It should go down.\n\n> At any time between now and November 6 the person who bought my put has the option to make me buy 100 shares at $34.\n\nYes, though it is unlikely to happen until expiration day, due to the loss of extrinsic value on exercise.\n\n> But what's the downside? The current price is $32.77 and the breakeven price is lower than the current price. This seems too good to be true what am I missing here?\n\nSince the IV for that contract is over 125, that's where the excess money is likely coming from. I don't think there is any particularly downside, you are just getting the benefit of all the uncertainty around NIO. Of course, if it drops below 31 on expiration day you are screwed, but that would have been true even without the IV inflation.\n\n> Also, is the put always automatically exercised? What if the person who bought my put went on vacation?\n\nNot always, and that's not how it works anyway. Someone holding that long contract decides to exercise. The OCC randomly matches a holder of the short end of the contract with that exercise. The selected short holder is assigned the exercise of the long side.\n\nHowever, if you are as deep ITM on expiration day as you are now, you are 99.9% likely to be assigned. The 0.1% would involve a dramatic drop in NIO's price right after the market closes on Friday. That could make enough long contract holders decide not to exercise that you might not get assigned.\n\n\n> At what point should I consider buying the put \"back\"?\n\nWell, don't open ITM shorts in the first place, but the time to buy it back is when you can make your desired level of profit.
