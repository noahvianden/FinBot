SHA-256 is a \"hashing algorithm‚Äù with certain properties that is key to how Bitcoin works in several areas. Hashing algorithms can be used in decentralized data stores to make it expensive to add data to the decentralized data store, while at the same time making very cheap to verify if a potential transaction added by someone else on the network to your clone of the datastore was added only after spending a lot of expensive electricity. One way it is used in Bitcoin is such that 1) you have to use a lot of computing power to be able to add a transaction (or techincally speaking, a block of \\~2759 transactions) to the network and 2) if some wants to verify that you used a lot of computing power (rather than you just being able to say \"I used a lot of computing power guys! Let me add the following transaction to the network (you transferring 1000 BTC to your address)\" and have everyone trust you) they can do so themselves with very little computational power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I understand correctly, currently it costs some amount less than $300k (depends on the price of your electricity / your mining rig setup) to submit a block of (about 2759  transactions to the BTC network. Simply speaking, the way BTC uses SHA-256 is it creates a virtual haystack and virtual needle and forces bitcoin nodes trying to add blocks (of transactions) to find that needle in that computational haystack. Every 2 weeks the BTC network tweaks how it uses SHA-256 to make that haystack a bit bigger or smaller, such that taking into account all the bitcoin miners in the world, some miner will on average find a needle in a new haystack every 10 minutes. Since currently the reward for finding that needle (the BTC network rewards people who spend electricity to add transactions to the network) is 6.25 BTC, miners currently must on average be able to find the needle with less than $312.5k (= 6.25 BTC \\* $50k USD/BTC) of compute costs to profitably operate themselves on the network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe \"256\" in SHA-256 means that some of the numbers being used to construct this virtual haystack, are 256 bits in length, aka there are 2\\^256 such numbers, also known as 1.16 \\* 10\\^77 numbers. As you could imagine, this enables the Bitcoin network to create very complex haystacks that take a lot of search time to find the needle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe BTC protocol is actually pretty simple and a lot of programmers learn it for fun. All this shows is that Andrej is nerd who likes learning stuff, not necessarily that TSLA is going into crypto, though if their powerwalls and megapacks end up creating excess energy w/ negative prices, attaching those to crypto mining rigs would be a no brainer IMO.

I actively sell CSPs and was making good money on them up until the last month or so. I intentionally went for high volatility stocks for the higher premium. I‚Äôve accepted assignment on several. With one (PLTR), I was looking at a $25k loss if I were to have closed it prior to expiration. I took assignment and it went up the next trading day. I sold the shares for roughly $15k gain without having to resort to covered calls. It generally doesn‚Äôt work out that quickly. I‚Äôve used covered calls to reduce the impact of downturns. My premium received lowered the basis on the shares significantly because I sold the CSPs a little less than two months from expiration, so it was a hefty premium. \n\nI‚Äôve also sold CSPs on stocks that I already own but have been beaten down. If assigned (and I have in a couple of instances), it reduces my basis. If I‚Äôm not assigned, I‚Äôve made active income on the CSP. As a precaution given the high volatility with some of my positions, I‚Äôve essentially created a short strangle on an existing stock I own (specifically TLRY), where I‚Äôve sold CSP at a lower strike than my existing basis as well as CC at a decent level above my existing basis. If they expire between those price points, I just keep the premium. If it goes one of the other ways, I‚Äôm still ok‚Äîif it drops then I lower my existing basis and keep the premium from the call. If it increases then I keep the premium from the options and offload the shares at a profit. \n\nI have shares in more stable companies, but honestly most of my portfolio in this account is cash. I generally keep $1.5- $2.0 mil in cash so that I 1) never have to screw around with margin even though it‚Äôs a margin account, 2) can respond immediately to any change in market conditions or sudden opportunity, 3) have liquid assets on hand in case of an emergency, 4) can have several CSP positions open at once. \n\nSo far this year I have realized gains of roughly $150,000 on the CSPs that I‚Äôve closed or that expired in my favor. I‚Äôm fine on those I‚Äôve been assigned. Either my thesis on those stocks will prove true and I‚Äôll have gains on them, or I‚Äôll look at the positions at the end of the year and determine what will be useful for tax loss harvesting. Full disclosure: I have earned more on pure stock trading in the first part of the year than with CSPs, due to GME (bought at $21, sold at $170), CCIV (bought at $11, sold at $60), TLRY (bought at $10.50, sold at $45, this was before the CSPs I was assigned on recently), and some other smaller but still profitable trades. That means I can be in the position to look at a potential loss on something as actually being useful. You may not be in that position. \n\nI am not advocating for what I do as a strategy to be adopted by others. My point is that active income in a decent amount is possible with CSPs and other trading strategies used together, but it requires active management and a fairly high risk tolerance. You still have to know when you‚Äôve reached your ‚Äúnope‚Äù threshold and get out of a bad position that has potential to get much worse. I never sell naked calls.

{"title": "NrdRage's Friday DD...on a Saturday. Market is as confused as a Zoomer exposed to good music, so instead of something new, let's re-visit the last DD's, see where they shook out, and update them (DD \"Where are they now\" 30 for 30 edition)", "selftext": "Hola!   NrdRage here.  My apologies  for not posting this yesterday, but  Reddit, with their extreme ethics  (?) put me in a corner for 3 days for  upvoting a couple of comments my  daughter made about motorcycle  safety.  Good to see their priorities are  in order, An upvote from the  same NAT, that's way more important than  employment background checks  on pedophile enablers, right Reddit?\n\nGiven   that last week's DD was my first complete WHIFF (seriously,   embarrassingly bad, but we'll get into that), I'm going to work hard to   find a layup for everybody next week.  Think I've found one, but with   that tax bomb President Harris tossed out yesterday, I don't want to   name a new ticker, even if I think it's all smoke (because the mere act   of sabre rattling can shake a market, and there's sure to be plenty  more  of that in the coming weeks as the administration attempts to  normalize  the plan to create the actual highest cap gains tax rate in  the world).   So instead, let's go back through the DD's (the ones I  haven't deleted  because they were no longer effective, at any rate) and  update them and  where I am with them.  This should hopefully, for at  least a day, stop  people from grabbing a DD from 2 months ago and  jumping in then  wondering why the trade is different.  Oh, who am I  kidding, I know you  fucks, nothing will stop that.  At the very least,  it should shut up the  small group of people who played the trades wrong  and declared them  broken.  Let's start from February, so right after  the first round of  people who \"liked the stock\"\n\n# DD #1:  $PLTR.  Original Date January 27th, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I tried to tell you retards](https://preview.redd.it/pqrvl3j266v61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b59d3513e9581b0babd63301fc9dd1cb8482387)\n\n**URL:**    Ended up deleting it - not because the DD was wrong, but because the   Palantards got it to about -700 karma and I decided to let them get   crushed.\n\n**Original thesis:**    $PLTR (then $35) was wildly overpriced based not only on their market   cap as a company who's almost every dollar is already priced in as a   result of their reliance upon government contracts, which span years,   their reliance upon the courts to force those contracts to be extended,   but also because the company insiders were selling stock like mad,   George Soros had signaled he was going to sell the 4% of the float he   controlled for \"ethical reasons\" (hah!).  Oh, and because Peter Thiel   participates in the wrong type of political ideology amongst the tech   elite, that he was so unfavored that there would be active attempts to   harm his ventures.\n\n**Original price target:**    I stated the company was worth no more than $22 and that people  should  open $25 puts expiring in late March.  In later comment updates,  I  stated that one should buy puts any time the company strongly  eclipsed  25, and should buy calls any time the company sinks to around  22, as  that's its rangebound territory.\n\n**How did it work/what has changed:**   Not a single thing.  It was literally impossible to screw this trade  up  unless you went against it.  So, of course, most of this sub did  just  that and lost money.\n\n**What the smart play is on it today:**   I no longer buy puts in $PLTR, but any time I see it creep to 22, I  buy  a biweekly $22 call.  Easy money that I will then put on the end of  a  fishing pole and hold over the head of a Palantard.\n\n**Trade rating:**  10/10.  15 bagger (and counting), plus you got to point and laugh at half of this sub.\n\n# DD #2:  Weed Stonks.  Original date February 3rd, 2021 (a non-Friday DD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rsk2tbc566v61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf756ce0a9fad711fd9fce0af241b7768ec065c3\n\nURL:  [Right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh6ttf/pass_the_bong_and_gather_round_bros_were_gonna/)\n\n**Original thesis:**     You're the bad kind of retarded if you were throwing money into  SNDL.   If you wanted a \"cheap\" stock, you should go with one that  doesn't put  fucking rubber and plastic in their weed - so to buy a  stock like  Organigram instead if you could remember their stupid  fucking name.   $APHA and $TLRY should be joined at the hip and either  APHA must come up  or TLRY must come down.  Talked about $CGC and $ACB,  though didn't  endorse them.  Matter of fact, I didn't really endorse  any of them.   This DD was more about \"well, I can't tell you not to do  this stupid  thing, but if you're going to do it, at least make less bad  choices  amongst the stupid ones\".  Way to make me feel like a pearl  clutching  Boomer parent, assholes.\n\n**Original Price Target:**    I didn't give any, because it was all obviously a bubble and I was   mostly advising people to be careful with the play, but to pick better   companies if you were going to jump in on it.\n\n**How did it work out/what has changed:**    If you read between the lines and TRADED (read:  Scalped like Crazy   Horse) these stocks instead of invested in them, you probably fared   pretty well.  All the weed stocks peaked a week later and then started   their decline (except for $APHA, which continued to rise for a while   before collapsing as it tried to find equilibrium w/ $TLRY).  My own   results were originally mixed on this.  I made a lot of money scalping   Sundial before getting out of the way at the top and laughed as it   collapsed to the surprise of a million braindead stoners.  I made some   pretty decent money on TLRY, made quite a lot on APHA (and then gave it   all back and then some on a stupid play for the merger that expires on   the 30th, a nice 7 figure waste of money), and made some money on   Organigram, but I kept the 1/22 $5c's and am reasonably certain they're a   complete loss, but just like bagging Olivia Munn, there's always a   chance.\n\n**What the smart play is on it today:**    Don't touch any of them.  The reality is, long term, these Canadian   companies are going to have a hard time penetrating the US market, even   if the product is federally legalized.  But, more importantly, the one   thing every weed company has in common with one another is that they  are  absolutely TERRIBLE at execution.  This is why you don't make  stoners  CEO's of publicly traded companies just because they're  passionate about  the product.  They've got the easiest product out  there to sell, and no  matter how low you set the bar, they somehow find  a way to trip over  it.\n\n**What you should play instead if you want to get in this space:**     $MO.  Yeah, you heard me, $MO.  Think about this a moment:  These   guys sell tobacco.  A product that they are forbidden from marketing or   even talking about, which gets hidden away behind cages in stores,  which  has been completely wiped from movies that might product place or  even  being MENTIONED in public because of regulations.  A product  which in  some places it's illegal to use in your own home or alone in  your  vehicle as you take a 10 minute break from your soul-sucking job  and  question every choice you've made in life, just hoping to get 5  minutes  of sweet relief before you have to head back behind the Wendy's  to  finish your shift....and they STILL sell billions of dollars a  year.   Say what you will about their product, but these fuckers **know how to execute.**    And they're already in America.  You don't think that they won't be  at  the front of the pack when that shit gets legalized?  You don't  think  they won't give up the brown leaf for the green leaf?  You don't  think  they won't start buying up every Ganja Goddess or Chronic ReLEAF  store  they can find once they're allowed to?  Fuck outta here.\n\n**Trade rating:**    8/10:  You made money if you followed it and got out a week later,  you  made even more if you caught how lukewarm I was on the entire  sector  and picked something else, and you saved a lot if you got out of  Sundial  like I said, but the weed play really died out a very short  time later,  so the upside was very limited.\n\n# DD #3:  $BB.

My positions were very early, so my average PPS  is  7.67 and my calls are 5's, so not really playing the same game.  I  have  since added, over time, a load of 1/23 42c's at an average cost of  like  80 cents.\n\n**How did it work out:**    Thesis still holds, though it would sure be nice if the green number   reflected a mammoth spike in equity price.  The only reason this  company  isn't sitting at 20 right now and well on its way to smart  vehicle  dominance is because of the damned chip shortage.\n\n**What the smart play is on it today:**    It's still buy and tuck away in a hole somewhere like a Boomer.  Grab   the farthest out, farthest OTM calls you can find (they should be no   more than 50 or 60 cents).   You'll still be a massive disappointment to   your parents, but maybe you'll be able to trick them that you're   starting to grow up enough to where they'll let you move out of your   refrigerator box and housesit for them when they go on a cruise.  Hey,   speaking of....\n\n**Trade rating:**    5/10:  I expect this one to age like wine and ultimately be a huge   profit maker, but the chip shortage was a resistance point I failed to   consider so it hasn't seen the immediate burst.\n\n# DD #4:  Cruise lines.  Original Date February 19th, 2021üì∑\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Not mine.  But I wants it.](https://preview.redd.it/onkncs8c66v61.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b139c61852f25bfc1b0a4d831afc7aa42eebf86d)\n\n**URL:**  [For you poor bastards who missed this boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnpqrp/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_bermuda_triangle_and_you/)\n\n**Original Thesis:**   The cruise liners were one of the last Wuhan-fucked plays   out       there     who hadn't taken a true turn at the recovery wheel   just   yet.      Which   made   them smooth sailing for easy tendies\n\n**Original Price Target January 2022:**  $NCLH 46, $CCL/$CUK 47/42 respectively, $RCL $90.  My     positions      were    established a month and a half before the DD, so     my cost   basis    was    different.  I was holding 700 1/22 25c's in   $CCL and   2000 1/23    $42.5c's    in $NCLH.\n\n**How did it work out:**    If you jumped in shortly thereafter and played the stocks      right,     you    made enough to buy your own boat.  Sure, maybe it  was  a    17'     Bayliner    that all the women at the marina called    \"adorable\"   and  were    clearly    conflating towards what they    assumed was your    pathetic 2.5\"    penis size    at diamond hardness,    but it floated, it    had an engine,   and  dammit, it    was yours  and   you had enough left    over for a   captain's  hat and a bunch     of   beer money.  This one  was   hard to screw   up -  especially since  it    was   the first one I   started  providing   updates on  and made  sure    everybody   knew to take   profits  at 32 on   NCLH and buy   back at  29  (and  to continue     playing that  range), etc.    People  in  these   from the date  of posting   who   didn't  just buy and    hold likely    have turned at least a 6    bagger by now.     This trade  was,   and to   some  extent is, still solid    gold.\n\n**What's happened since then:**              In spite of none of the companies in question needing to    issue        shares   as they had enough cash on hand, $RCL issued    shortly  after    that    DD,  $CCL  immediately copied them, and $NCLH    followed  suit a    couple   of  weeks   after $CCL.  At least none of    them tried  to pull  an   $AMC  and   have the   CEO go on TV and  give   zero credit  to retail    investors  for   saving the   company  and   instead taking  all the  credit   before  diluting   and then    paying   himself a fat ass  bonus  for doing   nothing  but issuing    shares like     some sort of  conquering  hero.  The   amount of  the  dilution   in   question   meant  that the  resistance  price  of (to  use  as example,     $NCLH) of $32 a    share  already  represented a   higher  price than   the   pre-virus share   price.    Ditto  for the  other  2.   Investors   haven't seem   to have  noticed,    however,   and these  stocks  still   trade in the  general   range,  though the     resistance  level is now    more like 31/25/85.    Also,  the  sailing    schedules  for  the   domestic  cruise ships has  been  pushed   back  as a   result of     somebody high up at  the CDC  obviously  shorting    these  stocks,  as    that's  the only  explanation  for why they're   so   focused  on trying   to   send these  companies to 0   by  preventing   sailings.    Norwegian  is  resuming  cruises  outside  the  US in the next   couple  of   months.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**              These 3 companies are no longer as attractive as a result  of     the        dilution, but they're still good swing traders within   their       respective     channels.  I'd put up a picture of some   charts to  show      those, but I     already told you where the   resistance is,  grow a      wrinkle and learn  where    support is.\n\nI          have since   exited  my positions in $CCL (and was never in    $RCL),     and   have   drastically  reduced my holdings in $NCLH, but I    do  still     maintain a    skeleton crew  of January calls for them.\n\n**Trade rating:**              9/10.  It was really hard to fuck this one up, unless you    just        didn't   believe me. And it's still a live trade.  The only    thing  I       could have   done better was post it sooner, but I  make   sure my    trades     are   established and going the right way  before I   talk  about   them in     depth.\n\n# DD #5:  The Semiconductors:  Original Date February 26th, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[And before you ask, yes it is.  Took this the other day when I   decided    to    start working on this. In retrospect, should have   washed first.](https://preview.redd.it/y6vlid9g66v61.jpg?width=1530&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bfae5eeadc261cda360675c53f44c33d6ca1582)\n\n**URL:** [For you poor, broke ass souls who missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt89s3/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_semis_play_not_just_the/)\n\n**Original Thesis:**          While everybody was spooging over high end chipmakers like  Theta        Semiconductor, $AMD, and $NVDA (and, to be fair, I had been   telling       people to buy $NVDA 545/580c's, which were all   multibaggers), the   real     action was in the commodity level   chipmaker space,  specifically    American   companies (or companies   that could masquerade  as them) who    would line   up to the trough to   get some free  government money to go    from being   nofab to fab   companies.\n\n**Original Price Target:**          $NXPI 200-210 within 3 months; $ON to within 43 within 3  months,       $MRVL  to 75 within that same range.  And I didn't give a  price   target     for  $UTZ, just that it would go up.\n\n**How did it work out:**          LAMBOS for almost everyone!  Supposing you could order one,   given      that  they can't get the chips they need to build the cars.       $NXPI   got   to  214 before pulling back to 202.  $ON hit 43 2  weeks   before I     predicted  it would.  $MRVL failed to live up to    expectations and has     been  essentially dead money since that    posting, but if you'll  recall I    was  very explicit that I was    bullish on them ONLY as a 5G  play,   whereas  the  others I felt had    more range and scope.  So  short-term   $MRVL play  was a  loser if you    moved up the timeline I  liked.  Oh, and   $UTZ printed  for   everybody   that just bought in  because they liked the   product.  It   was a   nice  little pocket play.\n\n**What's happened since then:**          The trade ran its course to perfection.  As I've been saying  for  a       little while now, semis, with the exception of $NVDA, are  not     presently    an interesting trade because there's been a  rotation out  of    them  after   this period of growth.  I am still  incredibly  bullish  on   the  sector as a   whole, but they need a  breather and  some time  out  of  the  sun before   continuing a leg up.   They're not  even good   rangebound   trades right now.    And LOL @  any of you  clowns who bought   $TSM  anyways  because Cramer  and his  cult of  Shortbus All-Stars   told  you  they were  the best in breed.   Suckers.    In the case of  $MRVL,  they  acquired  another company and  now are  going  to  \"officially\"  become a US  company  instead of that  tax  dodging shit   they've been  pulling, which  means the  thesis  about  them lining up for   gubmint  money is sound and  will happen   down the  road.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**         Ignore semis till at least June; probably July.  I have exited   out    of   all of my positions and have taken immense profits from the      commodity   semis.  I similarly got rid of my $NVDA calls at the  top,     though I am   willing to find a re-entry point in the 575 range  if  it    happens.  Don't   be sad that the trade is over, be glad that  it     happened and you might   have been there.  Or at least be happy  that I     was there and am   appreciative that I got to stack a bunch  more  paper    I'll never spend.    Either way.\n\n**Trade rating:**  9/10.  Absolutely perfect call, with only $MRVL being the laggard, but it came with the appropriate warning.\n\n# DD #6:  $CLNE.  Original Date March 5th, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4er1pwi66v61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a69c73b90b3d059645e2d9f3f61af090f7c8921\n\n**URL:** [Got buried in a mountain of Gibbons doing dumbass \"DD\" on their stonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lye7st/nrdrages_friday_dd_ok_one_of_you_apes_needs_to/)\n\n**Original Thesis:**         People are finally willing to take greenhouse gas emission   capture      seriously, and the infrastructure and transport sector is   finally   ready    to start moving away from diesel and traditional oil   based   products  in   favor of carbon negative renewable natural gas -     especially  companies   making carbon pledges or located in states   where   progressive  leadership   is going to demand emission reduction.     $CLNE  was uniquely  positioned  as  the nation's leading provider  of   that  fuel source and,  unlike all  the  other green energy   EV/charging   companies out there,  actually has a  real  product that   they sell in   large quantities, making  it a diamond in  the  otherwise   pipe dream   green energy space.\n\n**Original Price Target:**  $17 by late May, $31 by next March\n\n**How did it work out:**         I said to buy it as soon as it got under 11.  It got under 11  the      very  next trading day.  Then immediately shot up almost 50%  within   10    days  and was one of the few stocks out there  consistently   finishing    green  while the entire market was tanking.   As long as you   played it    smart and  heeded warnings about stonks  not always just   going up and    taking profit  after parabolic rises  and looking for   re-entries later,    then you made  enough money to  put RNG high powered   engines in both  your   boat from  cruise stocks  and your Lambo from   semis and convert  your   entire house to  being  powered by cow farts   before the green  energy   sector got   skullfucked.  If you held, you'll   feel this trade  didn't   work out   (though it still will, if you   picked the June target  date like   I  said)  and, if you re-entered   after taking profits, you've  either    been  averaging down lately as   this has been getting unfairly  dragged    down  with the entire green   energy sector or else you're   underwater on    it....but you'll still be   fine.\n\n**What's happened since then:**         A LOT.  From them getting dragged down from the mid 15's all the     way    to below 10 on nothing but good news to them signing major      partnerships   with $BP, Total and Citgo, to signing a half a billion      dollar deal  with  $AMZN to power their long-haul fleet with RNG to      Washington DC  flat-out  stating that methane capture is a capstone  of     their green  energy plan,  there has been nothing but good news  coming     out of this  company.  And  yet It got absolutely PUMMELED  with the     sector for the  last month, and  then this past week  started Monday     morning up 27% only  to not only give  all of those  gains back but  lose    another 20% by the  close of trading  Tuesday  because of a  combination    of market  manipulation by a hedge fund   that shorted the  stock into    oblivion for a  hit and run (do a search  on my profile by  posts and  look   up my Wednesday discussion if you  want to be  absolutely fucking    infuriated that someone borderline  committed a  crime) coupled with them    paying off an analyst at RayJay  to run a hit  piece on the $AMZN deal  to   try and sink  the stock  price even lower,  right down to that hedge   fund  suppressing  the  price of the stock  for 2 weeks to keep it under   $12 so  the most   popular options for  April would expire worthless.    This  company has,  in  short, been  subjected to a biblical level of   fuckery  that was  probably  was some  Mortimer Brothers bullshit for a $1   bet, and  it's  still  standing and  ready to spring. Oh, and somebody   informed  me  that they  got some  airtime on Cramer's show on the 24th.    Jimmy  Retard  is luekwarm on   them, and you should always inverse him,   so  balls to the  wall, baby.    Especially since he tried to compare the    2009 version of  this  company  (when nobody gave 2 shits about nat   gas)  with the 2021   version (where  governments are going to force   people  into this type  of  product and the  transport industry is   finally  transitioning away  from  oil).\n\n**What   the smart play  is today:**    My thesis, as written back then, is  EXACTLY  what I would  write even   today.  I stand by every last thing  in there,  including  the strike date   and price, in spite of the hedge  fund  bullshit that  artificially tanked the stock for no reason other  than  unmitigated  greed.  It was my   favorite stock in the whole  market then,  and it  still is now, just   balanced against the  knowledge that, as a  very  small midcap bordering on   a small cap,  it's easy to push around  and  very clearly fucked some hedge fund  manager's wife or something. If  you  don't believe me, every   analyst  out there says this company is  worth  double what it's at now. My  original position still exists, except now  it's bigger and I'm also the  owner of a lot (and I mean a LOT) of shares  on top of it that I was  gobbling up like a porn star eating all the  money shots in an episode  of Blacked on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n**Trade rating:**    10/10.   Nobody was talking about it before that DD.  You made a   multi-bagger in  just a few days if you jumped in, and even though   you're battered and  bloody right now on the 2nd run with them because   of the manipulation  from a hedge, you're still going to make mad   tendies with this one.   They've got EVERYTHING going for them,   corporate America is looking to  them for the carbon negative fuel as an   easy way to lower their  footprints, no competition other than a  shitty  (4 letter word for non IPO company) building their first   capture plant  who has NO fueling depots or infrastructure, politicians   demanding  carbon neutral fuel and, unlike most of the sector they  reside  in,  actually have a product and make money.\n\n# DD #7:  $BE.

Oh, and  politicians finally  acknowledging that  our utility grid is well beyond  end of life and hot  garbage and not  wanting voters blaming them for  citizen deaths being  willing to spend  taxpayer money to address that.\n\n**Original Price Target:**  70% conviction of a $32 price by mid-April, 45-50 by August, and a long term target of $72\n\n**How did it work out:**    I  had the unfortunate pleasure of posting this DD right as the  entire   green energy space was being crushed by big money rotating into   \"value\"  and later into \"the 10 biggest companies in the S&P to  make  SPY go  up\", so things haven't gone as planned to this point.  The   stock has  actually fallen from the 27's all the way down into the  22's,  though it  has rebounded this week and looks to be starting a  fresh  run.  It's a  bit of a hail Mary, but that 5/21 32c that I was  hyping  back then....it  might still print.  Though even I rolled over  my May  calls to August at  the same strike to buy more time to make up  for them  getting dragged  down with a bunch of companies that aren't  even in the  same space as  these dudes.\n\n**What happened since then:**     They haven't announced any big deals, but I know they're working on    some.  And they set up a new global office in Dubai to start marketing    their products worldwide, which should only give them tailwinds going    forward.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**     I still stand behind everything written in that DD, with the only    thing I'd like to change is the expiry date on the calls from May to    August.  And again, if you're sitting on May calls that are way, WAY    down....I wouldn't cut bait with them just yet just because they're    already almost worthless and there's still a puncher's chance they fight    back.  This thing has started to get some life, and I wouldn't bet    against it being able to hit that strike in a month - well, I wouldn't    bet a lot.  I would just feel better if it were 4.  Long term, this is    still going to be a great investment.\n\n**Trade rating:**    I was  going to give this one a 2/10 just because it had been going   almost  straight down for weeks now killing the May expirys, but the   longer  calls and shares are still very much alive, but I'm going to   upgrade it  to a 3.5 because it's made some good movement, and I will   cross my  fingers that, by this time next month, I'll call it a 6.\n\n# DD #8:  $RYCEY.

The stock hasn't really moved    since that DD, and should still be tucked away.  The condition for   their  recovery (increased air travel) has not yet happened, therefore,   it's  not their turn yet.\n\n**What happened since then:**     People have continued to be afraid of their own shadows.  Especially    the Europoors, even though England no longer even has enough cases to    qualify as being in a pandemic.  Dumbasses.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**  Same as it was then.  Buy shares.  Hold.  My positions haven't changed.\n\n**Trade rating:**  4/10.  Their turn for recovery is taking forever, but it'll get there.\n\n# DD #9:  $NVTA.

Transformational technology, market leader.  Also, gave me an   opportunity to collaborate with Cathie about the stock (though, because   of my, to be charitable \"un-PC\" vernacular, she declined to put her  name  on the DD).\n\n**Original Price Target:**  50 by mid June, 60's by 2021\n\n**How did it work out:**    We're now officially in the space where the long-game trades are  still  developing and can't yet be judged.  The stock, typical of every   biotech, has been very choppy in this uncertain market.  It opened up   big a couple of days after the DD, but has drifted downwards since that   point.  The volatility still makes it a great intraday scalper, and the   thesis is still sound.\n\n**What happened since then:**   The rotation away from high multiple high growth stocks has continued,  especially after President Harris  proposed increasing the cap gains  tax to the highest in the world.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**    I stand behind the DD and thesis, and the entry points are still   attractive.  I would move the strike price down into the low-mid 40's,   however.  My position has not changed.\n\n**Trade Rating:**  Incomplete.  Still developing.  I was very clear this one was not for the faint of heart.\n\n# DD #10:  $NEE.  Original Date April 9th, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dl8kuuq66v61.jpg?width=1033&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56ad32cd35498f28f7998cdca7e268907f7c3175\n\n**URL:** [You're late, but here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnksim/nrdrages_friday_dd_ill_take_a_mackinnon_jersey_2/)\n\n**The thesis:**    The $ICLN ETF, which was mostly just $PLUG, was rebalancing in a big   way; Blackrock would thus be purchasing massive quantities of shares of   stock in the new companies.  $NEE was uniquely positioned because it  had  the stability and rotation safety of a value stock, but the  multiple of  a growth stock\n\n**Price targets:**  I said definitely take profits at 83, and my positions were June 75's and 77.50's.\n\n**How did it work out:**    Flawlessly.  The stock basically rocketed to $80 as Blackrock   purchased shares much more aggressively than anticipated, and anyone who   played this trade with me and watched volume would have noticed the   volume fell off a cliff and took profits before it started creeping back   down (as everybody else was taking profits, too).  I exited my   positions near the top and stacked all the money in an air conditioned,   humidity controlled room that consumes immense amounts of coal power.\n\n**What happened since then:**    The share price has started to pull back, which was expected.    Further, they had an earnings call, and you should almost never play   earnings in this environment.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**    This trade is effectively finished - it was predicated upon a   rebalance, the rebalance happened, it was a lot of fun, we all made lots   of money.  This is still a really well run company but the short-term   thesis is no longer valid.  The DD will stay up only as a display of  the  company's operations, margins, and overall growth potential if you  want  to act like a Boomer and be a long-term investor.  I pulled out  all of  my short-term positions, and only maintain shares at this stage.\n\n**Trade rating:**    10/10.  Took even less time than expected for the trade to complete,   and was never in any danger of doing anything but printing tendies.  No   matter when you bought leading up to the rebalance, your position was   green and stayed that way the whole time.\n\n# DD #11:  $ISRG.

Analysts had been   lowering expectations for $ISRG for weeks, and even management was   saying things to make it seem like they were going to have a subpar   quarter.  Which made sense, given that a lot of operating theatres are   still closed.\n\n**Price Targets:**    As it was an earnings play, didn't list any long term, but suggested   going long in a company that typically only melts upwards when the  stock  fell by 60 or 70 bucks.\n\n**How did it work out:**    Not even slightly.  At all.  Absolutely TERRIBLE call.  They blew the   doors off earnings, beating by more than a dollar those lowered  analyst  expectations.  Sales were up.  Procedures were up.  Everything  was up.   Instead of going down 10% on weakened guidance, the stock shot  up 5% and  blasted through all-time-highs.  This was a big time loser  of a trade.\n\n**So why did it happen:**   I can't take credit for digging this up, that credit goes to /u/Farmer_eh who did  all the sleuthing of HOW they pulled it off.  It turns out  $ISRG  accelerated depreciation on a lot of their production equipment,  and  also had an increase in inventory.  This means that they had a bunch  of  extra Da Vincis laying around in a warehouse and were selling them  to  medical centers at a steep discount, which is why they sold so many   more robots than any analyst expected (30% more than pre-COVID sales),   and also lowered their expenses for the quarter.  These are neat tricks   that a company can only pull every so often, and it was smart of $ISRG   to not only have that one in their pocket for a rainy day, but also the   wherewithall to play the card at the best possible moment.  So, in a   way, the thesis itself was sound and the quarter would, in fact, have   been a down one had they just been organic about it all, but I failed to   account for easily accomplished accounting magic and motivated sale   pricing to ensure a quarterly beat.  Which is something I'll remember   next time I think about shorting a company that beats on quarterlies   almost 90% of  the time.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**    The original DD talked about letting the stock price come down and   then going long, because this is a company that is mostly always going   to go up.  However, it's run up so fast after those earnings that even   long is a dicey play now, so this is a company that, if you aren't   already in, you should probably stay away from.  However, buried in that   DD was commentary about how $PLUG had been beaten down to the level I   wanted to see it go to already, and that it was time to go long in  them.   I've had a couple of you message me, showing that you had read  between  the lines,  to say you covered your puts after that and went  into  calls.  So those are paying off.  As the green energy sector is  starting  to rebound a bit, $PLUG will naturally get caught up in that,  so  there's a play there.\n\n**Trade rating:**    1/10.  It was going to be a 0, but, as mentioned above, if you had   read between the lines there, there was a secondary play buried in there   about $PLUG calls, so I'll give 1 single, solitary point on this   otherwise complete dumpster fire of a call.\n\nAll my love\n\n\\-Chad Dickens\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPost-script:  Holy shit did I learn about how aggressive the autofilters are today.

Both they and $NVDA are churning out product at full capacity, as are their AIB's on the GPU side.  The chip shortage ONLY exists in the commodity level chip sector (so chips for cars, 5G towers, low performance systems, etc.), not the high performance sector.  The fact that you can't find any of their processors or GPU's is not because of a shortage of silicon but rather because of a generational level of demand due to a whole confluence of happenings.  Which sounds good on paper, but what this actually does, in effect, is places a cap upon $AMD's earnings ceiling.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying $AMD is a bad company.  Su Bae made me a lot of money, they fire on all cylinders, and they crippled $INTC with one of the great ambushes of all time.

It wouldn't matter if you handed EVGA 10 billion chips for 3080 cards, they would still only be able to make as many cards as they make.  If you look back to $NVDA's Pascal architecture for the 10 series GTX's, there were similar constraints based on production limitations; that wasn't a chip shortage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we talk about chip shortages, we talk about destruction of fabrication capabilities in China and Malaysia on the commodity level of the sector.

Hydrogen still isn't built out in terms of infrastructure and they're still figuring out how to make the damn batteries work.

The ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù targets being thrown by many analysts out there (up to $40!) are little nutty, IMO. For example, NCLH peaked at around $60 before the collapse. At the time, they had about 213M shares outstanding. Today those shares are trading at about $30 and there are at least 368M of them out there. Their debt shot up from ~$7B to ~$12B during this time. Cash on hand of about $3B is still burning daily and will be until at least midsummer (with a very good possibility extending to at least mid-late fall). How is this a 30-dollar stock, currently? Even with bookings being back up to what they were pre-covid (although I remember the RCL CEO taking about very favourable 2022, not 2021, just a few weeks ago -> more cash burn), on the balance sheet it is not the same company as it was in January 2020.\n\nFurthermore, they currently don‚Äôt really have any revenue and burning cash daily. There is a lot of uncertainty about the future, like shitload a lot. There is also a good likelihood of some green regulations coming rather sooner than later, which all the cruisers will need more cash for.\n\nTheir market cap went from ~$13B to the current ~$11B, while EV from ~$20B to ~$18B.

That credit is not compatible with any other offers however (discounted cruises fall into that ‚Äúcannot be combined‚Äù category, from my understanding, and that is all it‚Äôs going to be about for while, imo; just go to the deals on their webpage and see the hefty discounts they currently offer). I am thinking that instead it will be greedy investors who will be grabbing those shares on any hint at some positive news, disregarding the fundamentals. But that works just the same and probably better, lol. \n\nRegardless, yours was a good call. There appears to be some solid support just above $26 and it is at a resistance now; the next resistance seats at ~$33 (these numbers are from a quick glance), so there are some swing money to be made there.

Never bought into it because I‚Äôm not an OTC special kinda retard. What is it? Multinational Pharma research company dealing with psychedelics such as psilocybin and MDMA. It‚Äôs about to be listed on the NASDAQ on April 27th under the ticket $MNMD. Friday, the stock price jumped 65%.\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, these therapies are on the path for FDA approval... eventually. The research insofar has been promising for treatment-resistant depression and PTSD. But MindMed doesn‚Äôt have anything past phase 2 clinical trials. THERE IS NO INDICATION THEY WILL GET ANYTHING ONTO THE MARKET IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS. According to the FDA, about 33% of drugs which make it to phase 2 actually pass onto phase 3. That being said: if you‚Äôre willing to take those odds and have disposable income, have at it. But also think about the clinical practicality. On the company‚Äôs website, they describe their therapy as giving patients psilocybin, blindfolding them, and giving them headphones with a special playlist so they can vibe out FOR 8 HOURS.\nHow is this practical in an outpatient doctor‚Äôs office? Until there is an abortive treatment for psilocybin trips, I don‚Äôt see this working out on a large scale.\nSure, the stock will likely pop off for a couple days.
