{"title": "I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!", "selftext": "**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,\n\n>If r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash\n\nNow that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.\n\nBasically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.\n\n**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.\n\na. One-Quarter\n\nb. One Year\n\nc. Two Year\n\nd. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)\n\nAnother feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spgynoo1yaw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d9488dba90b8e5cc6c3d1f7fbe1b195eaa19f33\n\nAs we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \\~2X and two-year returns were \\~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbgvei0byaw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=396b7166c2d8b9069e119c7cc9af43b63afd6511\n\nBut it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.\n\n**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**\n\nThe stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.\n\nBut I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.\n\n>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.\n\nWhatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to Motley Fools.*", "id": "n1sr08", "created_utc": 1619785587.0, "score": 1245, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 195, "comments": [{"body": "I hope you enjoyed the analysis.

The reason I say that is I have a feeling, though I can't provide for it, that the companies selected by Stock Advisor likely are just \"drifting\". What I mean by this is that they are mid-cap companies with little to no threat of going bankrupt; in that case the odds that they will rise naturally over time are very high.\n\nIf one were to invest in a 5 factor model type portfolio one should beat the market by means of simply reducing diversification, that is, one never buys the losers with the winners, and so if one doesn't have the \"drag\" one doesn't have bad returns. This is the same problem as putting all of your money into Amazon; it would look like a genius move today to do so but if you had factored it and decided that it was a sound investment 2x years ago you'd have made a lot more than the SP500 specifically because Amazon *in* the SP500 is being dragged *down* by other things.\n\nI don't know how much of the portfolio recommendations are in the SP500 today but if it's a large enough amount one of the key factors for them could have been just choosing what would enter into that index, or rather, any index; companies that \"qualify\" but aren't actually in the indices are also high priority targets simply because in order to get into an index you have to have your finances right to begin with and you need to be, among other things, particularly business savvy which means no one is afraid you'll go bankrupt.\n\nThe sell recommendations probably run the same logic; much like we pick winners by looking at their fundamentals and likeliness of maintaining value and future-forward concepts there's a good chance that they either dump or discourage things that are either no longer viable or almost impossible to maintain. For instance the Tesla recommendation wasn't actually a \"bad\" one; 2020 was a strange year for certain but the odds that Tesla would have been in play in that year without all that was going on are probably not that high. The same is true for a number of closures of businesses as well; it required an extraordinary event to take the mundane to godlike. Now I'm not saying that Tesla isn't an industry leader or that it's CEO isn't who he is but I am saying that the widespread nature of the concept here is significantly dependent on the timing rather than the merits of the business itself and the viability of the technology which is still in early stages.\n\nI guess what I am saying is that without an analysis of just the general nature of the companies suggested and when there's a missing link; there's likely a sound commonality between the companies that can effectively be taken with little effort but they're counting on people simply not doing that; furthermore we do have a recursion to consider, that is, much like Kramer, if it appears in \"The Fool\" the natural outcome of that company may be changed and the trajectory raised esp. since they release, like Morningstar and others, their own price projections which I assume they release in their own favor meaning that they generate the buzz, set the price floor, and then let drift work on companies that were generally mundane but also relatively safe or with competent serial entrepreneurial leaders who don't fail often in businesses.\n\nThat's what I think is under the hood of the data itself.

{"title": "I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!", "selftext": "**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,\n\n>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash\n\nNow that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.\n\nBasically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.\n\n**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.\n\na. One-Quarter\n\nb. One Year\n\nc. Two Year\n\nd. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)\n\nAnother feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qg04a2wabbw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0486800be95f3c49097df601935236a2bc500b11\n\n As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \\~2X and two-year returns were \\~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xq68n5kbbbw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=327a831304a22ffb7588037b74da15e2de559e9b\n\nBut it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.\n\n**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**\n\nThe stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.\n\nBut I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.\n\n>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.\n\nWhatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to Motley Fools.*", "id": "n1ttf5", "created_utc": 1619789216.0, "score": 848, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "This is terrible news.\n\nGood analysis, but terrible news.\n\nNobody likes MF.

Its a long post, but if you ignore the rambling at the bottom, its not too bad. I would like to have a discussion of this. Bottom line is: I think the v9.0 combined network started to ignore the radar, thats why they throw it out. Elons justification that humans dont have radar is an after-the-fact explanation.\n\nHave a look:\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/n1p9iu/throwing_out_the_radar/\n\nIt seems the post is only visible for me, but not for others. here is the meat of it:\n\n> So what I think happened, with v9.0, Tesla moved away from having a dedicated radar post processor and plugged the radar output directly into the 4D surround NN that they are talking about for quite some time now. So the radar data gets interpreted together with the images from the cameras. I am not 100% certain that this is what they did, but if I was the designer of that NN, I would have done it this way.\n\n> Now, when you train a NN, over time, you find some neurons, that have very small input weights. This means they would only rarely if ever contribute to the entire computation. In order to make the NN more efficient, these neurons usually get pruned out. Meaning, you remove them entirely so they stop eating memory and computation time. As a result, the NN gets meaner and leaner. If you are too aggressive with this pruning, you might lose fidelity, so its always a delicate process.\n\n> What I think happened with the radar data is, that the NN gave the radar input less and less weights. Meaning, the training of the NN revealed, that the radar data is actually not used by the NN. Remember, you would only see this when combining all input sensors into one large NN, which is why Tesla only now discovered this. So when your network simply ignores the radar, whats the point of having the hardware?\n\n> Elons justification along the lines: 'well, humans only have vision as well' is an after-the-fact thought process. Because if the computer would actually use the radar data and help make it superhuman, there is no point going this argument line, you would keep the radar regardless of what human are capable of. Why truncate the capability of a system just because humans are not able to see radar? Makes no sense. So from all that I heard and seen about the functions of the NN, I am fairly confident that the NN it self rejected the radar data during training.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I get 'deleted' when I click the link.\n\n>I think the v9.0 combined network started to ignore the radar, thats why they throw it out.\n\nBut interesting statement. Could be part of the explanation. I also believe Elon mentioned saving bandwidth was part of the reason.

There is compelling evidence that the radar's tesla was using did not have the fidelity to provide useful training/driving data. See the argument from @Christiano92 in the twitter thread. So they have two choices (1) upgrade to an expensive ultra high resolution 4D radar like Waymo is using, thereby breaking backwards compatibility with the entire existing fleet; or (2) go with vision alone.\n\nGiven the leaps and bounds that 4D vision has made in developing a real-world model (as seen by Karpathy's demos), it seems like (2) has a real chance of success and it's an obvious choice to try hard at vision-only before falling back to (1). Big driver is not just per-unit cost but backwards compatibility with the fleet - if you can't bring FSD to the 2 million existing Teslas that's a pretty big write down.

I think radar is very good at spotting metal and determining the distance, but the radar they've been using has very poor angular resolution, so it's always getting false positives with things like overhead signs, bridges, etc. I believe it was throwing up so many false positives that they were basically throwing out all indications where the source was not moving toward or away from the Tesla vehicle, which got rid of many of the false positives, but which also caused Teslas to slam into trucks moving perpendicular to the Tesla, stopped vehicles, etc.\n\nYou can see from the beta videos that the visual-only system easily spots and avoids stopped vehicles.\n\nSo it was a matter of whether radar, with its many false alarms, was adding enough value to justify its many costs (listed above).\n\nNoticing reduced weightings in the neural net, if true, would potentially have added to the decision to eliminate radar.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Edit: I should have explicitly added that Autopilot/FSD is migrating from a condition where almost all of the actions are from code written by human programmers, to one where an increasing percentage of action (as well as interpretation) are learned and implemented by the neural net.

I have also never met or talked to someone that is doing what I am planing to do. For example all of my Coworkers bought a home from a traditional bank loan as soon as they had the means.

I can borrow at the starting rate of 1.57%(currently my rate is 1.2% blended rate on margin) I borrow from my shares a couple million for a home. That blended rate would be a very low rate. (.93%, based off current rates) that mean I would pay less than what I am renting right now, but living in a 2 million dollar home. It would cost me to maintain that interest on the home 18,600 dollars a year. 1550.00 dollars a month. \nOk so the argument is, it’s risky! Don’t use margin. Well the bank sees I have a paid off home, I’ll ask them to give me an equity line or a cash out refi if the TSLA stock dips in the short term and I’m worried about being margin called. Or! I can buy puts, and sell out of the money calls to protect from being margin called also. So there more than one way to skin a cat, but I’m also still learning.

I’ve been selling CCs on my Tesla for a while and I really like setting them far out of the money so the share price has room to run, but the options that are far out of the money are pretty much worthless if you’re looking at selling 1-2 week options. So if you want to sell 1-2 weeks out you have to be willing to either A. Not make much, or B. Sell really close to the current share price. To be concrete, check out a graph of theta decay. It accelerates as you come toward expiration date, and far out of the money options get decayed earlier. Close to the money options keep high extrinsic value for the longest, then decay rapidly in the final days/week. \n\nAnyway, because I don’t want my chairs to be called away week to week and go through the stress of wheeling back in by selling a put (even though the fat premiums are tempting), I follow the mechanics that the Tasty Trade guys use- namely: around 5-6 weeks out (the strike depends on delta, the IV environment etc but I like to sell pretty far out of the money), then buy it back or roll it when it’s around 3 weeks out or you realize 50% of potential profit. That way the theta decay is still decent, your gamma risk is lower (it really accelerates near the end of the options life) and you can sell farther out of the money while still collecting. So, positions wjll stay in play for 1-3 weeks, but you’re not playing the last few weeks to expiration. You put that  window farther out in time- you’re harvesting the theta from 6 weeks down to 3or 4, then moving it back out to 6. My basic management is this:\nSell 5-6 weeks out, and I like selling at the .1-.2 delta\nIf I hit 50% profit I close\nIf I hit 21 days I roll if it’s a net loss or close if it’s a net profit. (Then open another one, so kind of roll either way) \nAnd then adjust the above based on what the tea leaves/Elon’s Twitter tell me, ha. \n\nI’m sure you already know this but the delta is a decent proxy for what the market expects to be the probability that the option will expire in the money. So if you sell the .2 delta it means the market thinks there’s around a 20% chance that the option will be in the money at expiration. I like to sell at that low of a delta (.15-.2)because I’m still bullish on the stock so if it rips up 10% in a week I won’t be buried, have some room to roll etc.\n\nNow as for your original question - timing. It totally depends on what the tea leaves tell you. If you want to wait until it “looks toppy” then that’s totally valid just try to be realistic about your ability to predict short term movement. My personal preference is to just open based on what the market expects at 6 weeks out around the .15/.2 delta and then manage at 3 weeks remaining and not try to time stuff… most of the time. You’re a long term Tesla investor so you know what it’s like to disagree with the overall market, and I’m still bullish af… so my own preferences definitely influence when I open plays and how far out I set strikes, but it’s mostly my own set of tea leaves and what the hell do I know about predicting the future? ;). Anyway hope that’s helpful. Try to find mechanics that seem logical being on the seller side of the trade, trade mechanically, then as you get more practice adjust those mechanics to match your preferences about the underlying stonk and your desired position on it.
