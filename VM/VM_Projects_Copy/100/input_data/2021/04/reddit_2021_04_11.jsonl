{"title": "Avoid Trading the First 30 Minutes - Here's Why", "selftext": "  \n\nYou’ve done your research and you’ve found the next great trade. You can’t wait for the opening bell to enter the order and the stock looks like it wants to move higher. After a few minutes of trading the market also looks good and the stock is running so you hit the buy button. We’ve all been in this situation and here’s why you should wait for at least 30 minutes.\n\nDuring early trading buyers and sellers are jousting to see who has the upper hand. Much of the price action is program driven and the price action tells us how the day is going to unfold. All of your day trades and swing trades need to start with the market. Let’s take a look at the last 3 days of trading and what we learned from the early action in the SPY. \n\n**Wednesday** the market opened with tiny mixed candles. That is a sign that neither side has much of an advantage. Dojis and long wicks/tails are also an indication that the price action is balanced and that neither side has an advantage. The trading volume was also very light. After an hour of trading you would conclude that if you were day trading you should expect a tight range and that you should trim your size and set passive targets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY 5 Minute](https://preview.redd.it/d8v1i72jfks61.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=649e86a759b8b5a29ee51d7297693a26c94a0858)\n\n  \n\n**Thursday** the market gapped higher. Gaps to a new relative high have been faded and you should expect the bid to be tested. You need to be careful of a gap reversal and you can see from the green candles in the first 30 minutes that there is some buying. That tells me that a big drop and a gap reversal is unlikely. If there were going to be a gap reversal those green candles would not have been as big and they would not have come so soon. On the next drop we can see that the market almost filled the gap and that the new low of the day was barely below the prior low (marginal new low). The next series of green candles confirms that buyers are still engaged and that provides you with a better entry point. If you bought the open you overpaid for your position and you were exposed to a possible gap reversal. If you were day trading you might have been stopped out for a loss. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY 5 Minute](https://preview.redd.it/rhdb2dxsfks61.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd2a1ef61ff8c13207fb886cc0d74bb2b711723a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**Friday** the market started off with a series on nice green candles. That move was orderly, but the candles were tiny and that is a sign of resistance. That move lured in bullish speculators and the market was making a new high. After that initial push higher the market tested the low of the day. If you bought too early you overpaid. The market dip had tiny candles indicating that the retracement was also weak. On the low of the day you can see a long green candle (bullish engulf). That is a sign that support is strong at the low of the day. \n\nThe information that we get in the first 30-45 minutes helps us gauge the market. It tells us how aggressive buyers and sellers are. During that early action we can also gauge how the stocks we want to buy are behaving. If the market is going down and the stock is going up, I know the bid is strong and that the stock is ready to fly. If I buy the stock right on the open I do not have that information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY 5 Minute](https://preview.redd.it/bnu0bwvzfks61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ca2afc9065f3f96e2254a813874b23b1f26f7f1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\nLet’s use and example from last Friday. CRM looked great. The stock had formed a base on a daily chart, the stock had heavy volume and we can see on a daily chart that it was testing the 100-day and the 200-day MAs. Would the stock blow through that resistance or would it pullback? The market was strong, but the tiny candles suggested that there was resistance and that we did not need to chase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CRM 5 Minute](https://preview.redd.it/2a864rybgks61.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fea5371219ca78b6a104211f7a5e424f02564ca)\n\n  \n\nIn this next chart you can see how the market pulled back and CRM stayed very close to the high of the day. This is a sign of relative strength. As soon as the market found support CRM blew through the major moving averages and you had confirmation that you had an excellent entry point. You can also see the relative strength later in the day. Relative strength is my edge and I search for it every day for my day trades and swing trades. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CRM 5 Minute](https://preview.redd.it/c5ffiupigks61.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bdb351a0e10c2f6e275999449b8e021b92c6d75)\n\n  \n\nSome of you will look at the CRM chart and say… I would have entered even better if I had bought the open for CRM. In this case that is true. However, you did not know that the market was going to do or if CRM was going to retreat after testing the major MAs. \n\nFB has been strong recently as well. It opened a little soft Friday and it shot higher with the market. However, look what happened after that. The stock gave back all of the gains when the market retraced. That is bearish and it is a sign that there is selling pressure. If you bought this stock early in the day you overpaid. By the end of the day you might have decided to stop out for a loss. Luckily, the market had a strong day or the stock would have been down a lot more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FB 5 Minute](https://preview.redd.it/pqvxciangks61.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=d903ae83232c68d573b9fe79a994dd3cf89bb7e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\nTrading the open presents greater risk and greater reward. I have found that by waiting at least 30 minutes I can improve my trade entry. The market action tells me what type of trading day we are going to have and who has the upper hand (buyers or sellers). I can also gauge the stock’s price movement and I can identify relative strength. I hope this post helps you with your entry.

{"title": "Results: Using 3,762 TSLA shares to earn more TSLA shares by selling CC's and CSP's on TSLA.", "selftext": "I have a handful of posts in this subreddit earlier this year asking for advice on using a 7 figure TSLA position to sell CC's and CSP's to get more TSLA shares. I'm writing this post to share an update in case it's helpful for others. I didn't start consistently executing this strategy until February other than maybe a handful of trades in January. There have still been some weeks where I haven't sold covered calls as well due to fear of a large upside move but here are my results.\n\n*If this is of value to others, I'll do quarterly updates and link to the old posts. If it's not valuable, just downvote.*\n\n**TSLA Thoughts:**\n\nI am a huge TSLA bull. I bought shares for years prior to the large run-up last year. I believe Tesla will be the world's largest company before 2030. Potentially something earlier like 2025 or 2027 depending on a variety of factors. Plenty disagree. That's fine.\n\nLong term, I'm trying to get as much TSLA as I can.\n\n**Current Tesla portfolio:**\n\n* 3,762 TSLA shares ($2.5M)\n* Occasionally some LEAPS that I buy when I think TSLA is weak, short-term calls in TSLA but a max of $10k in a trade like this. (small percent of account but not really thetagang material though)\n\n**My strategy:**\n\nI sell a combination of covered calls and cash-secured puts on TSLA with the help of my margin in an after tax account and covered calls in retirement but no margin in retirement. My goal is to not get shares called away. On my covered calls, I sell weekly covered calls that are pretty far out of the money. I'll try to track my delta better next quarter but it's probably always less than .1 on every trade other than the CSPs. I also wait and strategically sell covered calls based on various events I know are coming up (e.g after Ark Invest released their new price target on a Friday I sold on a Monday after it ran up a bit in the AM).\n\n* For the CSPs I sell them 30 - 45 days out and will close at around 50% - 70% profit\n* For the CC's, I sometimes roll on a Wednesday to the following Friday if it's a strong day of gains \n\n**Main failure in Q1:**\n\nTSLA's first drop down to $620 I ended up buying to close many of my CSP's at a loss. In total, I lost something like $40k. I really wasn't thinking very clearly and let emotions rule me fearing that the market was going down. Had I just held on the price of TSLA recovered that day back up to around $700. None of the CSPs were expiring soon at the time.\n\nFor me, I only learn by experience and I'm fine losing money while I learn.\n\n**Overall results:**\n\nI have other stocks that I have sold covered calls on but I'll exclude them from the results.\n\n* Retirement account: 1600 shares\n* Started early Feb: **$13,570 in gains to date**\n\n* After tax account: 2162 shares\n* Started in Feb: **$6,388 in gains to date** \n*(Caveat: I have $20k in short term TSLA options gains that have buyoed these results that aren't really thetagang material, so without those I'd still be digging out of the hole a bit).*\n\nWhen I began this strategy I was looking for something really low risk like .1% per week selling covered calls. So for example, a 4/16 815c would qualify based on Friday closing price of $677. Now I find myself being a little more aggressive in my retirement account because getting called away isn't a taxable event. I'm less aggressive with covered calls in my taxable account but I'm more aggressive with my CSPs mostly selling ATM or 10% OTM (below current strike) because a worst case scenario of being assigned shares above the current price of TSLA isn't too much of a concern to me.\n\nAdditionally, at first I was looking to just buy TSLA shares but now I'm doing a bit of both. I'll buy TSLA with premiums if I think the share price is low and other times I'll buy other stock. I have a couple hundred shares of TWTR that I bought just using covered call premiums for instance.\n\nI believe Q2 will be a better indicator of how I can do with this strategy when I do it more consistently.\n\nI'm interested in any feedback and I should mention I am not an expert at all. I am just trying to find ways to use a large account balance to make more money. If I include other stocks for my retirement account that I sold covered calls on then my results for Feb - April so far are more like $30k+ in gains.", "id": "moz0g6", "created_utc": 1618173964.0, "score": 239, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Firstly - major props for the effort and sharing.\n\nReading all of this, and doing a couple of quick calculations, I’m thinking this is a lot of effort for 20 - 30 grand.\nIt makes a lot work, and if I followed correctly, you had to have lost on a least a little of the biggest upside I think I have ever seen on TSLA last year.\nAnd, you add some risk.

I'll reply with a few different points:\n\n* 1. I've had a few losses. \n\nA. One time I had 5 CSPs that I sold on TSLA (note: I'm using my margin to sell the puts) and I bought to close some of those CSPs after a really steep decline one day in TSLA rather than just holding on and seeing if the stock would come back. That was a $40k whoopsie.\nB. I had a 725p that I decided to take assignment on so I could wheel the shares out. I've sold covered calls on that set of 100 shares 3 times now and haven't had them called away yet. So not  really a loss yet because if TSLA goes above 725 sometime soon there are odds that I have a covered call sold to get the shares called away at a profit.\n\n* 2. \"Picking up pennies in front of a steamroller\"\n\nThis is where it's tough. My attitude was that my position size is large enough that it was worth the effort to see if I could make this work. Q2 should be a much better judge now that I've learned a lot more. I think I could probably do like $20k - $30k a month which I do think would be worth the effort. \n\nThere are only 5 times in the past 52 weeks that TSLA has gone up over 24% in a week. My covered calls are often less than 24% out, but in these situations where it's gone up over 24% in a week the following week historically has been a lower gain. Only one time was it like back to back massive weeks. So I figured that I could roll up and out until the stock leveled out. Worst case, I could use my margin and buy to close and re-evaluate.\n\n* 3. If you need income just sell 5% or less of your TSLA\n\nI'm still working a job and running some businesses that I own. I'd rather not sell any shares until Tesla is at a multi-trillion marketcap. Instead, I think \"Well, if I can add $200k into TSLA at these prices now that will be $1M or more later this decade\". Granted, plenty of people don't see it with Tesla.\n\n* 4. I hope you’re not YOLOing it. At the levels you are at - capital growth is usually less important than capital management.\n\nI have other assets. If all of my TSLA was gone, I would still be fine. If I was retired and not earning an active income I would consider rebalancing my portfolio.\n\nOverall: I'll see what I can do in Q2 and do a new thread.\n\nI am not ruling out the possibility that this could be a waste of time and potentially cost me some money.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I think the comment \"I'm waiting for a multi-trillion dollar market cap\" is insane.\n\nTesla has 2 - 3 years *MAX* before they start getting real competition in US.

Right now, in Fremont, they are running a few production lines that are pretty much their first ones built for the cars they are making and they have little ability to stop them in order to improve quality.

The credits are due to increasing efficiency requirements, which if you actually think about it, will continue to increase until car companies are probably between 90%-100% EV. So likely minimally 15 years before we see these credits go away and probably about 5 years before there is any meaningful decline in the credit revenue. In any case, if Tesla is not already profitable without the credits, I believe by the time the new factories are opened this year they should become clearly profitable (i.e. due to costs of producing and delivering the cars going down... the 4680 cells and single casts should also mean improved cars as well, so demand should continue to exceed supply for a long-time).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What happens when FCA, VW, Mercedes, GM, Ford, Hyundai, et al. make enough EVs so that they don't need to buy credits from anybody?

From a legislative standpoint, if you want to promote EV adoption you need to continue to increase efficiency requirements which means the credits are not going down anytime soon. You can model this on a spreadsheet easy enough, and depending on exactly what efficiency requirements are pushed the credit market can easily increase. Only companies that are full (or almost fully) electric will have extra credits to sell.

While Tesla can be in the mind of average consumer be compared to a Lamborghini, a Ford is just that, a Ford. A vehicle you purchase for its intended use, of a great value and good price/performace ratio. \n\nLamborghini does not care about price/performance ratio, and can therefore sell their products on 1000% profit margin, while a Ford is still just that, a Ford. Profit margin lets be generous and say 10%. \n\nIn order for a Ford to produce same amounts of profit for the investor, a Lamborghini produces one car, and a Ford has to produce 100 of them. \n\nNow to a Tesla. Obviously, it is overvalued. But by how much is impossible to tell, because you just cannot put a price on brand perception when it reaches the same consumer impact levels of Gucci, Apple, LV and other similiar brands. Value proposition goes out of the window when you realize that consumer DOES NOT BEHAVE RATIONALLY. Some consumers are forced into a rational thought, but lets be real, would you want to own a Ford or a Lamborghini? \n\nTarget market of Teslas is the same portion of consumers that purchase Apple products. While there are some really great features, main point is to purchase that brand, no matter it does the same thing other brands do ten times cheaper, its shiny and other people perceive it as a valuable item, and consumer feels like a better person. From company perspective, App store is the entrapment of consumer and a vehicle to extract even more money though services. A tesla is basically a big battery, steel cage and wheels. It can become a living home if you make a cage bigger, it can become a truck if you give it bigger wheels. It doesn't matter one bit what its real value proposition is from a mathematical and fair value perspective, just as Apple does not make sense when considered from a mathematical perspective. The invisible added value creates simply too large X% difference for any calculation to be remotely correct. \n\nMy prediction is some growth for a while, then sharp fall, and back to the top just like Apple we go. \n\nThis is not any financial advice and i have 0 shares.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "> it is estimated that over 400 Tesla employees contracted SARS-CoV-2 between May and December\n\nI would be interested to see who made that \"estimate\", do you have a source?

But the nice part about Tesla is that they aren't resting their laurels while ahead. They're putting more research into battery technology. Because they know how much they can improve.\n\nSeriously, do more research on their batteries, how they're all in on batteries. Understand that batteries suck and whoever can make them not suck wins capitalism. If we can get a lightweight highly efficient battery, it'll completely revolutionize our society.

[Piles of bodies](https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/piles-of-bodies-seen-in-myanmar-as-violence-escalates-reports/) have been spotted. Seems sort of brazen, right?\n\nWell, this is the world on the brink. It's happened before in history. **Powder kegs happen**. The stresses to the international system by the virus sort of guaranteed this would happen. The goal of China is to become the new reserve currency, and things are going great for them in this regard. The Chinese [Belt and Road](https://fortune.com/2021/03/24/china-belt-road-initiative-soft-power/) initiative is killing it in Africa and other developing parts of the world. They are getting 99-yr leases and debt-trapping small countries, whose leaders walk away with big fat Chinese money as they sell their countries down the river. I wish they had a ETF.\n\nI am no psychic, I cannot predict how war will happen. I can't tell you how we'll get dragged in. But I can tell you that we are the biggest weapons manufacturer in the world, and war has been historically enormously rewarding for war profiteers. Again, **powder kegs happen, and you want to be invested in the explosion when you see one.** Here's how:\n\n**BA**\\- These fuckers [drop engines](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/22/dutch-investigate-boeing-747-after-engine-parts-drop-after-takeoff-netherlands) on houses in flyover country and go on a run. Insanely bullish, with vaccines and travel lining up at the same time as international tensions rise, BA is in an amazing position for the rest of 2021.\n\n**RTX**\\- Biden's cabinet is full of Raytheon guys. They are positioned to cash in on air-to-air missile contracts, air defense systems, missile interceptors, fucking everything. Tensions are the best thing for this company because they can get in there and start moving their defense equipment. They are on the cutting edge of advanced technology, not only landing defense and civil contracts, but also cybersecurity solutions. These guys are the fucking best in the world, and they have been landing contracts nonstop. The Pentagon just gave them and LMT a contract for [missile interceptors](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2021/03/next-generation-interceptor-thing-contract-announced/172870/). This is a company dabbling in money and power most of us can't fathom.\n\n**LMT**\\- This thing has been [outpacing the broader market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-outpaces-stock-215009624.html) lately, as it goes on an earnings run. Up 11% in the past month, it's the strongest in the class. Earnings are estimated at $26.32 per share, year-over-year change of +7.43%. This company is a big fat juicy hog and lined up to make a killing off increased tensions. Dumb money isn't the reason this is going up, I promise you that much.\n\nThere are multiple ETFs that cover this sector, or you can buy the individual companies.
