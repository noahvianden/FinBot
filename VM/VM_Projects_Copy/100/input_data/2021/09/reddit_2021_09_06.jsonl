I've mainly been attracted to the wheel on value/solid stocks as a strategy, but I have also been looking into iron condors as a secondary strategy in the current market.

These are amateur, though, and I fully believe I'm missing something. \n\nTake one of the better ones: \n\nLCID - $19.61 - Long Put: 17.50 (0.07) Short Put: 19.00 (0.25) Short Call: 20.50 (0.21) Long call: 22.00 (0.07) Total Credit: $0.32 (or $32 per option).\n\nThe PoP is listed at 65.9%.

The calculation here is designed to come out as even expected value, so it is useless to calculate expected return as it will always be 0 as far as I can tell (I'm not a mathematician).\n\nThis is confounded ever further by the fact that the lowest probability trades seem to have the highest expected values using the above formulas.

Your elementary school teacher would never ask you \"if you don't have any apples and you give one to your friend, how many do you have left?\"  The question doesn't make any sense.

Certain option trading strategies exploit certain types of short term trends that are more predictable than random chance. And even a completely random outcome is still exploitable for profit if the [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result) is positive. For example, suppose I were to offer to wager with you on the flip of a fair coin. You would risk $1. If it is heads, I win your $1. If it is tails, you win $2 from me (and you keep your original $1). Would you take this bet? Would you take this bet if you had to play at least 100 flips?\n\nThe answer is that everyone in the entire world should take that bet every day of the week and twice on Sunday, because it is a tremendously +ev bet.

The main question is: **how quickly can I react if I want to take an automatic action upon assignment?**\n\nBut I have a few other related questions.\n\nFor all questions, assume the underlying has no dividends and is HTB/NTB and the options are far (more than a week) from expiration.\n\nIf you bought an option, up to what time (of each day) do you have to exercise them? I've read its something around 5:00 pm for the day of expiry, but what about for early exercise? Is it still 5 pm each day? Does this means you can still do something with options after-hours (exercise/not exercise), even though you can't trade them directly?\n\nIf you exercise a call, can you sell the shares right away? Do you have to wait? Assume the underlying is HTB or NTB so we can't gloss over this and similar questions by just being short the underlying for less than 24h.\n\nI've read that [Robinhood will exercise the other leg](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m2uq9l/psa_early_assignment_on_robinhood_can_lead_to_max/) of a spread if assigned early. Fortunately, I don't use them. But this means at the brokerage level, there's some way to react immediately? Or is there a 1+ day delay between the two exercises even when Robinhood does it?\n\nI've been early assigned on before (on covered calls so timing/reacting wasn't too important there). But I only received notification from my brokerage at midnight. Is this typical? Markets are obviously closed then. Again assume a HTB/NTB underlying so being short for a few hours isn't an obvious answer. Does this mean spreads on HTB/NTB underlyings have inherently greater risk even when the spread itself is reasonable?\n\nIf this was a Friday (but no the expiry Friday), does this mean you can't do anything until Monday (when the stock price may have moved)?\n\nI understand that the counterparty loses extrinsic value upon assignment and this is *usually* enough to deter early exercise. But it seems like they'll do it anyways sometimes (like with my CCs), possibly because they can exercise AH.\n\nFinally how are assignees selected? I've read that it is random among the open interest but can't find a primary source describing the mechanics of this selection. Is there some way to tell your broker you'd like to be more (or less) likely to be assigned?\n\n(The answer to how the assignment mechanics work may render the following question non sensical.)

Yes, the low supply of existing homes has definitely contributed to the spike of home prices and COVID work-from-home has no doubt contributed to spike of home prices where the general public did not expect. But, what does this all mean? Imagine a household making 100k buys a 500k house. Let's say that same household makes 150k, through wage inflation and/or promotions tries to buy that same house, but only to find out that house now costs 1MM. Assuming 20% down payment, the 500k homeowner has 420k of debt, whereas the 1MM homeowner has 800k of debt. If wages do not grow with the rate at which homes are appreciating in value, we're simply adding more debt to our personal households. Again, this is fine, because homes appreciate in the long-run, but it's also the premise of why I feel that we're just one or two massive layoffs away from a market crash.\n2.

I can imagine once this nightmare ends, many landlords would be interested in selling the property, to realize the investment gain, as opposed to being a landlord again, as a result of the headaches and unpredictability of collecting rent.\n3.

Otherwise covid would have been the perfect excuse to do exactly that. \n\nAs for your other point about landlords selling off after the moratorium… wouldn’t that just create downward pressure on home values and therefore make your “one or two layoffs” argument less valid? \n\nAnd all of this still requires a catalyst for mass layoffs.

Actual employment to total population ratio is a more accurate indicator. And, that number was hovering just over 60% pre-COVID (and now 56%). \n2. Yes. How would that make my layoff argument less valid? I'm merely using this as an example of how the housing market **could** collapse, assuming there is a sudden flood of landlords wanting to sell their home. \n3. Whether we want to believe layoffs are coming, or not, many of my management consultant friends are busy right now automating tons of jobs. From F500 companies down to mid-size and small-sized companies. So, yes, corporations can indeed continue laying off more people. While you do make a good point that the \"best time\" for corporations to do layoffs was during the height of COVID, keep in mind they also can't conduct massive layoffs without having implementation plans in place (and of course getting other executives to sign off on it).

But if insist on protecting the money against inflation then you are looking at the wrong asset class. You should be looking at bonds which have a safer risk specifically TIPS(treasury inflation protected securities). \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with bonds here is a quick break down. Bonds pay coupon payments a percentage of the par or principle value of the bond. E.g a bond sells for 1000$ and has a coupon rate of 3%. You get 30$ every year until the maturity of the bond. They are usually semi-annual so you get paid 15 every 6 months.  Yield to maturity is the estimated yield you would get if the bond is held to maturity. At maturity you collect the face value of the bond. Say you held the bond had a maturity of 2 years then you get your 1000 back plus 60 from your coupon payments.\n\nBonds have 2 major components of risk principal and interest risk. This can get complicated but all you need to know is if interest rates go up bond price go down and vice verse.(if you want me to explain I can, just let me know) There are ma y different types of bonds and not all have the same risk.\n\nHow does TIPS solve your problem? \nWell as the name suggest TIPS moves with inflation. If inflation rises by 3%. Then the principle value increases by 3% as well as your coupon payments. If there deflation the principle value decrease as well as coupon payments.

If you sell the option then buy the underlying, you gain the intrinsic, the extrinsic, and the underlying.\n\nSo my thinking in your situation would be:  Calculate the extrinsic on those calls currently and divide by number of shares under option (100 usually).  If you think that AMC can move up by more than that much by next Friday, keep the calls.  If you don't, then sell them and gain the extrinsic before it decays away.\n\nPS.  Nice job getting AMC 4c.

{"title": "Return of the Meme King: TSLA Going into 3Q-4Q", "selftext": "Attention fellow glue-sniffers,\n\nIt has been 10 glorious month since my last post regarding Tesla, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx4hl6/sp_inclusion_and_the_tsla_hug_of_death/). It worked out...well.\n\nThe time has come to revisit our favorite meme stock coming into the end of 2021, as lil Tesla shakes off the flaccidity and grows turgid in Charlie Sheen tiger-blood fashion.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\nThese are the catalysts for stock movement. Your personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant, which is important to keep in mind. You are going to be judging how the market and others react en masse, not how well your own blinking 40 watt manages to read tea leaves.\n\n1. **Full Self Driving Beta (FSD)**  -  Tesla offers driver assist functionality that goes beyond the scope of most driver assist programs. Far beyond. It is not widely known just how far ahead Tesla's neural net (NN) technology and software stacks that run FSD are. There are two key dates related to this catalyst. 9/11 is the rollout of a fully integrated v10 release to FSD beta testers, then, according to Elon, the next release will be 9/24 for 'the button'. The button is supposed to offer FSD beta to a wider audience of nearly 360k testers. This is *not* going to be a quiet affair. The more relevant piece amongst our slightly glue-inebriated brethren is actually that it allows *deferred revenue recognition for 3Q21 for collected FSD premiums*. This could be a significant upside surprise in 3Q earnings, which are expected to be reported around 10/26. Some WS analysts will back them out as 1 time recognition, but even they will need to begrudgingly agree that they should have retroactively revised trailing earnings upward if they plan on backing it out. New revenues are a big deal on WS. A potential per share recognition just for FSD of $.80 is on the table, which would take the WS estimates of $1.45 and jump it to $2.25 for a casual 55% beat, even if it were the only upside potential. Even if it were universally backed out, which I don't believe it will be (as it is partially recurring) the headline upside risk is big and would be splashier than a PTA moms meeting with guest appearance by Jason Momoa.\n\n2. **Tesla's Problem Getting It Up**  -  Tesla has had a flat year. After a blowoff top following my last post the stock has lost steam and spent *a full 8 months* consolidating so far. That it is a bummer for the people that held it during that time, but it is a golden opportunity for a keen-eyed dingus with a share allergy. The thing to observe here are the future year earnings per share estimates. They are going up. And up. And up. Like God damned clockwork. There hasn't been a month where future year '22 estimates didn't increase in '21, and the average earning estimate increase in the past 6-months is... 27% (to $7.287 eps in '22). What has the stock done during this time? Apparently it has drunk whiskey and fixated on overly-inverted nipples, from my experience. The stock trades around $730, down $170 per share from its high earlier in the year. Granted, coming into the year with that blowoff top means that your calendar year statistics are going to be fucked, but still, the mourning period is over and Tesla should be hitting on the waitress at this point. Taking a look at the 5-year chart it looks like WS agrees. Ordinarily increases in estimates correspond to increases in share price with a positive correlation. Tesla shares are currently lagging this incredibly strong indicator for future earnings, and historically speaking WS has *underestimated* true earnings by a fairly large margin. 2Q showed us an absolutely insane beat from Tesla, and in 3Q I expect one of the greatest beats of all time in terms of both deliveries (should be announced early Oct) and EPS. Given the long consolidation period, I believe the managed funds currently underweight Tesla will be scrambling to pick it up either slightly before 3Q earnings in order to hedge, or immediately after the beat in a desperate attempt to avoid a massive underperformance against their benchmark from being underweight. Tesla's consolidation and increasing earnings have made the stock a much more enticing future year multiple for big funds that previously would have viewed it as outside of their risk tolerance. mini-TLDR: Funds aren't afraid to buy at this price point anymore.\n\n3. **Reconciliation Bill Passage**  -  This trigger is expected end of September. All federal budgets need to be submitted by 9/15, and then the house will attempt to pass a 'reconciliation bill' for the federal budget that includes a fairly innocuous line item that didn't make it into the first infrastructure bill. A *$7,500 rebate incentive for all Electric Vehicles*. If this passes as currently drafted it would be an enormous catalyst, effectively making Tesla's entire offering of vehicles much much cheaper. Tesla already has a several month long backorder, but if this portion of the bill passes unchanged Tesla gets the opportunity to either hike prices for even more absurd gross margins, or allow the rebates to help make their vehicles (which are already very popular) more accessible, further damaging legacy auto manufacturers like GM and F who are reliant on their internal combustion vehicle revenues to subsidize their EV lines.\n\n4. **Berlin / Austin Gigafactories**  -  Both Gigafactories are currently considered wildcards in terms of WS production estimates. With '21 estimates for Tesla deliveries hovering around 850k units, it doesn't appear to be factored in. In 1Q Tesla delivered 184k, and 2Q at 201k, so it stands to reason that Tesla is expected to hit the 850 in 3Q and 4Q just on the back of production out of Giga Shanghai and Fremont. If either Austin or Berlin comes online during 4Q (or as early as Oct, as has been reported) the deliveries could be meaningfully revised upward, not just for '21, but '22 as well, where consensus deliveries are a laughable 1.15m. If things start to look like these two factories are coming online in October, it would be a significant catalyst for upward PT revision.\n\n**What this means:**\n\nAn absolute metric shitton of catalysts are coming to a head at the tail end of 3Q and into early 4Q.\n\nWS EPS estimates will continue to climb. The disparity between share price and future year revenues will continue to pressure FY EPS.\n\nThis thing looks primed for another breakout.\n\n**What can go wrong?**\n\nIf the catalysts begin to whiff, it might be time to ditch out on the trade, or revise lower. I'll be keeping an especially close eye on passage of the EV incentive, and the news coming out of Berlin and Texas.\n\nVery little value is currently given to FSD in the valuation models WS creates, so I am less concerned about hiccups on that front. I am looking for a positive headline splash there.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI believe Tesla could actually move from its current $730 price point to a retest of $900 during the reporting season for 3Q earnings.\n\nFor this reason I am picking up $800/$850 call debit spreads for 11/19, which I personally view to be somewhat conservative. I also snagged a couple extremely cheap $900/$950 call debit spreads 11/19.\n\nI think all the signs are there that Tesla is finally ready to make an upward move once again.

Model S/X coming back into earnings, including the new plaid. Only a few hundred of these were sold in Q1 and 2, which supressed earnings significantly. Starting Q3, we should see them scaling these back up to over 50.000 units of annual production. The new Plaid versions are also significantly more profitable, so it should have a double positive effect.\n\n3. Lots of new cars are now being built with the single piece casted front and rear underbodies. Getting this production capacity installed was quite costly in Q4 of 2020, but we should start seeing the production cost reduction coming into effect now.\n\n4.

Any negative headline has an effect, regardless of whether it was priced in or not. Also, \"being price in\" is not some black and white concept.

POW’s Jackson Hole Speech. 😂 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I’m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I paid for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA first…which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level…I mean…it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**… and with everything going on in the world…you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble…but how was that even theoretically feasible? It’s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why…\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret…THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fuck sakes people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**“The team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.”**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So…yeah we’re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie’s future earnings… and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now…** \n\n             Wall Street‘s High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S and P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S and P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. 😳 So…. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings….which I guarantee that will happen… it’s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months…literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember…play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But…gold was up big this week as well…and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo…for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy…were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9….a very surprising miss. I wasn’t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear…I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it’s going to collapse our financial system possibly…also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant “Mu” and mass evictions will soon begin…**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n**Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr**\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on…. But you get the point by now…let’s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I’m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don’t get me started on the mass evictions as well…and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities… The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow…**my positions.** Take this into consideration… I’m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So…**Not financial advice.** \n\n**Short term Tendies:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term Tendies:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks… I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It’s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I’m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put…**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies… my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me… I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**…but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It’s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a “Black swan event”by purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars…Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI’m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I’m saying that maybe it’s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don’t forget **Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1mil**…another bearish catalyst for the market. I literally could go on and on guys….It’s pretty obvious at this point, we’ll at least to me…but what do I know? I just got out of prison last December. 🤔\n\nTLDR: Just read the bold shit…\n\nEdit: Just saw this on Twitter like 5 minutes ago, **“Household Debt Hits New Highs”** https://imgur.com/a/CEVZg7x\n\nLol…", "id": "pj24hx", "created_utc": 1630943723.0, "score": 1173, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 926, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|210|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Check out a Monthly SPX or SPY chart with a 5-period moving average.

If that gets confirmed in the upcoming meeting this month, then the crash is going to happen before the end of the year as the market starts pricing it in based on the confirmed start date. If they announce this month but won't start tapering until 2022, then that changes things. How it changes things is up for debate but I think it will throw the market into a slow bleed bear season instead of a quick 15-20% snowball crash event, or I could also see a sharp 10% pullback followed by a multi month bear season as the market stabilizes. \n\nPersonally, I am big time hedging for this months expected tapering announcement.

I was hardly confirmed with covid, the bounce back was insane, but my reading is also, if we were around end of cycle in early 2020, and we are past that now, I think we have only got back to that end of cycle position. \n\nOne thing however, cash is not safe in a world of hyper inflation.  Gold bars or coins would be better in that situation.  I have also put about 20% of my portfolio into gold coins and cast gold. The issue is, someone buying gold now, if proved wrong could lose 30%, but hyperinflation could be far worse.\n\nThe thing about hyper inflation however, Germany had it after WWI but the difference between Germany, Argentina, and the US is that Germany and Argentina had creditors from other countries, and the US does not.  The only, what you could call creditors the US have are holders of US dollars as reserve currency.  This has held the US dollar stronger than it should be for a decade at least.\n\nThing is, are people ready to hold Chinese Renminbi instead as their reserve?  Likely not yet.  So US dollar will likely remain strong in a world of increased risk and instability.  \n\nNow there are proponents of Modern Monetary Theory, that say that the US cannot go broke because it prints it’s own debt and the Fed Reserve holds that debt.  It doesn’t owe Europe or anyone else — as long as they don’t buy treasuries.  The worst thing that can happen is everyone sells their US dollars, it’s no longer the worlds reserve currency, but without enough gold in the world for people to hold, what are they going to hold then?  So this one is a big *if*.  I think perhaps one day the Renminbi will take this place, but I don’t think that has signs of happening this year.\n\nI’ve called the top so many times in the past 4 years, and almost every time I was wrong.

GDP Forecasts\n\nThese forecasts are typically done from quarter to quarter. Since Q2 of 2020, we’ve had over 6% GDP growth. With the exception of Q3 2020, which had a GDP growth of 35%. GDP has been very off because of COVID and it is returning to normal. We cannot sustain GDP growth of 6% forever.\n\n2. Wall St. High Expectations\n\nHow is the economy coming to a standstill? If companies are crushing their earnings, then the economy is NOT coming to a standstill. If anything, it’s too HOT. Which yes, does lead to inflation. But inflation can be controlled.\n\n3. Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nI Lol’d at this one. Do you know why lumber/gold has really plummeted? Because lumber was in a supply shock in April/May of this year and drove the price up over 200%. Over the summer as lumber mills started up again, more supply entered the market and prices have more or less returned to normal, leading to a more than 60% drop in prices from its peak, which is why the lumber/gold ratio looks all whacky. \n\nI’m not arguing with you that certain assets are overvalued. Home prices and equities are soaring, and I believe they are the effect of QE and low rates. However, market crashes are really hard to predict mate, because nobody wants a party to stop.

{"title": "Tesla (TSLA): buy shares today and you get the beast tomorrow!", "selftext": "# A cash cow getting fatter every day (read the summary):\n\nTesla reported second-quarter 2021 earnings of $1.45, which surpassed the analyst consensus of 90 cents per share. Higher-than-expected automotive gross profit resulted in outperformance. Precisely, automotive gross profit came in at $2,899 million, topping the consensus mark of $2,504 million. The bottom line also smashed the year-ago earnings of 44 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $11,958 million, surpassing the consensus of $11,389 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 98.1%.\n\nImportantly, the firm generated a free cash flow of $619 million during the quarter. This last point is essential as it means that Tesla can generate cash by itself. It implies that in the future they won’t be capital raise anymore which dilutes shareholder capital.\n\n**Summary:** Tesla destroyed analyst’s expectations and made tons of money. No wonder when you drive shit cars that you do not understand the future.\n\n# Everyone wants a Tesla (read the summary):\n\nDelivery and production totaled 201,304 and 206,421 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 121% and 151%, respectively. Tesla reported stellar second-quarter 2021 production and deliveries despite global chip shortage, thanks to the increasing popularity of green vehicles, preference for personal mobility, easier credit conditions, and economic recovery buoyed by accelerated vaccination drive as well as massive fiscal stimulus.\n\nModel 3/Y registered production and deliveries of 206,421 and 199,409 vehicles, reflecting whopping year-over-year growth of 169% and 148%, respectively. Meanwhile, production and delivery of Model S/X fell 63% and 82% on a year-over-year basis to 2,340 and 1,895 units, respectively. Even if this was anticipable, these are bad news as margins are whey smaller with model 3 and model Y than with the model S or X.\n\nTotal automotive revenues surged 97% year over year to $10,206 million for the reported quarter. This included $354 million from the sale of regulatory credits for electric vehicles, which decreased 17% year over year. Automotive gross margin was 28.4%, improving 298 basis points from second-quarter 2020. This is key as margins are what finally determine how profitable a company is.\n\n**Summary**: Everyone wants Teslas and margins improved. At least retarded start grasping the potential of these cars.\n\n# Energy and storage (read the summary):\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenues came in at $801 million for second-quarter 2021 compared with $370 million in the year-ago period. Services and other revenues were up 95.2% years over year to $951 million. These digits show that Musk is now able to use the knowledge developed for car batteries for producing home batteries used for saving electricity in countries where the electricity grid is no good. Moreover, the current trend in the decentralization of electricity production will lead to the increasing demand for such batteries for saving electricity generated at home, through solar panels, or other sources. By also having solar panels, through the acquisition of Solar City in 2016. All in all, it means that Tesla is getting closer to its target to be an ecosystem where customers produce their own electricity, save it overnight through batteries, and then can charge their Tesla.\n\n**Summary:** When some companies sell cars, Tesla sells electricity, storage, and cars. Even the dude buying the Ford Mustang Mach-E will use Tesla for its electricity and storage of electricity. So, I will get rich whatever EV you buy!\n\n# Why you will get rich (read the summary)?\n\n**Production target :**\n\nWhile Tesla has not provided any clear delivery target for 2021, it reiterated its goal of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Looking at the current results (+ 121% YoY), this target seems to be easily achievable and may even be overshot which would give a further push to the stock.\n\n\"Despite minor shifts in the timeline, we expect the introduction of Semi and Cybertruck to be positive catalysts for Tesla stock in the intermediate term,\" Baird analyst Ben Kallo said in a note to clients. He maintained an outperform rating on Tesla stock. His price target was raised to 764, from 736.\n\n**Risen estimates**\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review. The consensus estimate has shifted 8.09% due to these changes. This is key. It means that investors were surprised by the results of Tesla and become more ambitious about its future. Even if Musk promises a lot, analysts are still surprised and raise their target price.\n\n**Summary:** One more time, analysts are asleep. Tesla will smash their boomers’ expectations and the stock will go to the moon!   🚀  🚀  🚀\n\n# Dangers (read the summary):\n\n**Competition increases:**\n\nMeanwhile, China-based rivals **Nio**, **Xpeng**  and **Li Auto** recently reported sales.\n\n**Fake advertising:**\n\nEven if Musk presented a new humanoid able to do repetitive and boring tasks, some investors were not convinced of the realization of this project. They even perceived it as further proof that Musk is enabled to respect deadlines. For instance, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, in a note to clients early Friday said that: “Unfortunately, as we have seen with robotaxis and other future sci-fi projects for Musk, we view this Tesla Bot as an absolute head-scratcher that will further agitate investors at a time the Street is showing growing concern around rising EV competition and safety issues for Tesla,”\n\nThe safety issues Ives mentions are what investors should be attuned to right now because it appears the government is finally stepping up and taking note of a problem that seems essential: Musk repeatedly oversells the current and near-term potential for his automotive autonomy advanced technology.\n\n**Summary:** Some dudes are heavily buying Xi’s cars. However, Tesla is clearly above the competition. Uncle Sam is starting to be annoying with probes against fake advertising considering the software in Teslas. However, I believe that the government will be loud but do nothing in practice (as always).\n\n# TLDR:\n\nLast earnings show that analysts are old boomers who understand nothing about technology. Hence Tesla destroyed their expectations. Growth in deliveries was massive, profits and revenues jumped. Analysts are not only retarded but also have little balls. Hence, they doubt the capacity of Musk to reach his objectives and others are afraid of lawsuits again Tesla due to false advertising. No worries boys, Tesla is on the right track to reach its long-term goal. Soon we will all have full freedom over our production and consumption of electricity. Then we will go two times quicker than retarded analysts in our brand new Teslas.\n\nPS: I hold 20 shares of Tesla, worth approximately 14,666 USD.", "id": "pj790n", "created_utc": 1630958530.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pj790n/tesla_tsla_buy_shares_today_and_you_get_the_beast/) \n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Puffy_Reality_, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "look at my recent YOLO where I show my entry position", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "bullish and bearish so I got both puts and calls.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "How can you make money buying both calls and puts.
