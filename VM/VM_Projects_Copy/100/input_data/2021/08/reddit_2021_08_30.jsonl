I close trades for a 50% profit which is fairly standard, but it will be up to you to decide at what point to close to take a profit or a loss and what loss amount your personal risk tolerance will accept.  Some want to get out of losing trades quickly and move on, others will want to let the trade play out, this is entirely up to you . . .\n\nFor a loss example, if you collect a $1.00 credit on the trade with a max loss of $300 then you may want to close for a loss when the current value is, for example, $2.00 which would net a $1.00 or $100 per contract loss.

The rephrasing is a little clearer, but honestly, an example would be clearest of all. Like you sold a 460/461c SPY Sep spread for $.35 when SPY was 450 (so it clearly was opened OTM) and now SPY is 462 with 8 days to go on expiration and the spread would cost $1.02 to buy back, so you are looking at a $.67 loss when max loss at expiration is only $.65. Does my example correctly represent your question?\n\n> Is there ever a reason to close out this loosing position earlier than expiration?\n\nYes, because instead of $1.02 to buy back, the spread may only cost $.88 to buy back. That is, the loss for early exit might be smaller than the max loss at expiration.\n\nPlus, even if the early exit loss is identical to the max loss of $.65, there are risks associated with holding options through expiration, so you can avoid that risk by closing early, with no change in P/L. Time is money and the sooner you free up capital in a losing trade, the sooner you can redeploy that capital to a better opportunity.\n\nIf the loss for early exit is greater than max loss, it's a more complex decision. You have to weigh the loss reduction of holding through expiration with the risks that might occur at expiration. For example, suppose SPY falls to $460.98 at expiration. Now your short call is ITM and you are on the hook for the full $46,000 worth of short SPY shares (although you get a ton of cash to go with it), while your long call at 461 expires worthless. If SPY goes back up to $462 on Monday, you'll have a much bigger loss than if you had closed the spread for $.67.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "One important note is this is for credit spreads only, I didn't mention that but in my link to when I asked earlier I believe I was clear.  \n\nMy apologies for the vagueness.

I guess someone could do spread closer to ATM, but I'm not there yet.\n\nI'll give you the details but don't have IV or theta at time of purchase so if those are so important that's also why I didn't bother sharing all specifics.  Your example is good, are you able to calculate all that in your head?!  I'm sure I'm wrong but wouldn't the max loss be equivalent to the width, so $1?  This may be my fundamental misunderstanding. \n\nI had two examples.  One was AMZN where the put side was fully breached, the other example is GOOGL where my call side is fully breached.  To focus on GOOGL, here is a screenshot https://ibb.co/NN1H8n2\n\nThe call side was fully OTM, but is now fully ITM.  My loss shows $10,500 but will often show even more, like $11,500 or higher.

If something can cost more, it can cost less. IV works both ways.\n\nHere's how it could cost less. I'll just use a credit spread for the example, since an IC is just two credit spreads. Let's go back to my SPY credit spread, the 460/461c SPY Sep spread for $.35 when SPY was 450 (so it clearly was opened OTM) and now SPY is 462 with 8 days to go on expiration.\n\nIf there was no such thing as IV or theta, the 460 short call would be worth $2 and the 461 short call would be worth $1. Consider the cost to close, where you pay $2 to close the short and the sell to close value of the long call is $1, making the total cost to close (-2) + (+1) = -$1. That ignores IV and theta, or at expiration, which is the same thing. Since you received $.35 in credit at open, your max loss is (+.35) + (-1) = -$.65. That's what you would expect, right?\n\nOkay, now lets add IV to the equation. Suppose that IV inflates the 460 short call by $.20 but inflates the 461 long call more, by lets say $.30. So the cost to close the short call is now $2.20 and the sell to close value of the long call is $1.30. The total cost to close is now (-2.20) + (+1.30) = -$.90.  Adding the $.35 credit and now your actual loss would be -$.55.\n\nSo that's how your loss on closing the credit spread before expiration can be less than max loss, even though both legs are ITM.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "To quote trainspotting, “Beautifully fucking illustrated!”  Thank you.

Because if a stock is 13.52, the 7.50c has 6.02 of intrinsic value alone, plus it should have extrinsic value on top of that.

We often simplify advice to cover the 99.9% of the time where it applies in practice. As in this case, where 99.9% of the time exercising early loses extrinsic value. We give all kinds of simplified advice that ends up being wrong for some exceptional case, because most beginners won't face those exceptional cases until they have years of experience under their belts and no longer need the dumbed down advice.\n\nFor your specific case, we don't need to do a bunch of calculation. All we need to know is how much extrinsic value was in the contract when you exercised early. Whatever that number is should be a dead loss. For example, if the strike price is $7.50 and the spot price is $13.52 *and the call is worth anything over $6.02*, the amount over $6.02 is dead loss that can't be made up under the equivalence detailed below.\n\nAnd, comparing exercise to selling the option and buying the underlying is not really an equivalence, because it ignores the time delay imposed by exercise. The only way to insure an exact equivalence for a long call is to sell the shares short at the same time that you exercise. That insures that the price realized by selling the shares is exactly what is captured at exercise and hasn't changed over the time delay of the exercise. Then you can compare the P/L of that simultaneous pair of trades to a sell to close of the call.

I have been learning about buying credit spreads to reduce your cost to buy or to buy more options. I think this specifically works well if you are convinced of a price target for a stock. Typically this involves buying atm / slightly otm calls and selling the same number of further otm calls to reduce your cost.\n\nHowever, has anyone ever tried the reverse but an uneven spread (like selling atm / slightly otm calls and buying a higher number of further otm calls)?Let me try giving an example (hypothetical and simplified). Say some stock is currently trading at $10. I have a strong belief that this stock can reach >$40 by some expiry date. At present, I see $15 calls with a bid price of $2.00 and $20 calls with an ask price of $1.00 (same expiry date for both). Technically, I can buy 100x $20 calls and sell 50x $15 calls and not spend a single penny myself. Now if the stock reaches $40 anytime before expiry, both the options are deep enough itm to basically just have intrinsic value -- about $25 for the 15c and $20 for the 20c. At this point, I can sell the 20c and buy back the 15c to make me about 100\\*(100\\*$20 - 50\\*$25) = $75,000, essentially having invested nothing myself.\n\nIs this a feasible strategy? What potential downsides do you see to this? The only risk I can see is that if the stock price is close to $20 around expiry, then I lose something like 100\\*(50\\*$5) = $25,000 (as the 20c will be worthless).  \n\n\nEdit: Multiplied all calculated amounts by 100 since each option is a contract for 100 shares.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is known as a [ratio backspread, or back ratio.](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/call-backspread/)  As you can see from the P/L diagram, you have capped profits on the downside, unlimited profits on the upside, and losses in the middle.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I’m curious what the difference is between a long call and LEAPs.\n\nIsnt a LEAP just a long call that has an expiry date greater than 1 year?\n\nI looked up the definition of LEAPS on Investopedia and that’s exactly what they described.

He thinks the fed can't ignore inflation and taper and rates have to rise and it will hurt companies with high valuations the most. You've pointed out in your post that the nature of the companies she buys tends to have high valuations. In order for bonds to rise the fed has to let go of tapering and has to probably raise rates themselves also. If you don't understand exactly how the fed reserve rate functions and how it's not quite the same as setting the interest rate on treasury bonds but definitely does affect interest rates then I recommend learning about it. It is a bit nuanced but useful. Understanding exactly how the tools the fed has work is really important in today's market is my point. \n\nBased on that here's my opinion \n\n\nMichael burry fanboys just don't realize. When the dude actually IS right he's years goddamn early. You seriously miscalculate the level of irresponsibility that government officials can maintain when they don't want to either lose their position or get their cheeks clapped by the public. \n\nThe old saying used to be the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent\n\nThe current version is Jpow and the Biden administration\n\n- (who CANNOT handle a market downturn when he's dealing with the biggest foreign policy mistake in US in 100 years plus COVID delta surge plus inflation talk already scaring middle America while his left wing base demands trillions in new bills of spending or else he's the old white man traitor to the cause)-\n \nor just the government in general can remain drastically irresponsible and self serving way longer than you can remain solvent \n\n(especially if you start as early as Michael burry does with a thesis.)\n\nYou don't get that they've built everything on these negative bond yields and if you think they're going to do the responsible thing when it involves them also guaranteeing a ravenously angry public after a market crash directly due to the CHOICES and action of the government then I think you're a bit naive. \n\nRead the book burry himself cited at the beginning of all this shit. Dying of money. There's a free pdf. \n\nIt literally details how the government always goes too far with this shit and yet burry himself is betting that they just call it quits in the first inning?? The dude understands macro economics and data on trends that involves all of history and is great at looking at data but it's extremely clear he doesn't understand people at all. He literally was surprised when his bosses were furious at him for essentially yoloing a multi billion dollar fund on something that had never happened before (which he didn't exactly predict he found evidence of systemic fraud which allowed him to predict would eventually come out thus making the MBSs worthless) like yea great play but he actually didn't understand why they were mad at him. If his timing had been too off or if anything had occurred outside of his framework he essentially would've lost the entire fund on one play and the fact that he didn't get that they would be angry at him when he claims he's all about preserving wealth proves he doesn't understand people for shit. Let's also consider that he literally talks about how he doesn't understand people at all.\n\n\nHis own research should tell him his play is too early. If you read his book he loves so much you'd be like yea the reason we're fucked is because the likelihood that the government behaves irresponsibly for too long is ridiculously high. \n\nThis is the man who discovered the extreme corruption and fraud that caused 08 and then watched the government PAY THE BILL for the corruption and fraud the government that then INVESTIGATED AND AUDITED BURRY MANY TIMES WHILE NOT PROSECUTING ANYONE WHO BLATANTLY DEFRAUDED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY and then inflated away the bill that they used to save the country for that disaster. And this man thinks that government who has not changed the tiniest bit is going to behave responsibly. \n\nYou guys gotta think broader.

If there is major underlying rot like in commercial real estate or some kind of truly harmful event during this time we could see things much worse because the fed can't adjust its course until inflation has gone down. So we could easily go much lower in any sector. \n\nMid terms will be interesting assuming they play out like everyone predicts they will. Republicans will absolutely stomp out democrats if the current trajectory stays true and maybe that some how has a positive effect for markets but I see it as kind of a wash on effect right now. \n\nThe real only way for the market to come back is for prices of goods and specifically prices of oil to fall so that spending can rise and growth can come back. Or incomes could rise for growth to come back but I see very low chance of that right now. \n\nSo yeah with inflation as bad as its been I think it's way early for the fed to be able to step in at this point and unfortunately the market seems to want to consistently jump ahead of the fed in predicting when they're going to be able to go back to the \"good old days\" lol so i think at the moment any potential good news gets priced in way too quickly.

For example they have an immune system that protects them from diseases. If you grow them in a controlled environment, you wouldn't need that. Or plants like wheat and corn grow tall to get to the sunlight above other plants. Indoors, this wouldn't be necessary, What you would want ideally, for example in corn, would be just an ear of corn sticking out of the ground with two or three leaves to support it. There is no need to grow tall, because there is no competition. The plants could come to harvest quicker and you would need less space to do so. I think in the long run, the IP to make these vertically profitable strands would be much more valuable than the facilities they grow in. If you compare it with amazon, the genetics engineering companies are the ones providing the technical know how, the farmers just provide the warehouses.\n\n  \n2. **Data**: Vertical farms will be chock full of sensors. However, each farmer only has their own local datasets. I am sure the bio tech companies providing the genetic material will offer services to them to optimize their yield, or even contractually require the farmers to share all their data regardless of weather they will use these services or not. This way the biotechs will have all global data on their crops, thus being able to predict future yields and prices of crops on the world market. This way, even if there is a good year for farmers, they will be able to screw them out of their profits. Also, because they have all the data and can best optimize the yield, the farmer doesn't really have anything he can do to outperform his competitor. Farm a can be as good as farm b, if they both provide the optimal growth environment as recommended by the biotechs. This means that the most profitable vertical farms will win by reducing their cost. Again, compare it to amazon. If you want to run a profitable operation, you need to squeeze the wages of your employees and be in a location where energy is cheap and infrastructre is availabel. For the farmers, this isn't an attractive business, because they don't control these factors. They are set by minimum wage requirements and the infrastructure made available by governments.\n\n  \n3. **Overregulation**: Governments have in interest to remain somewhat independent in their food production. They don't want all the vertical farms to be in china or next to big dams where energy is cheap. They will step in with subsidies and regulations, to keep domestic food production at some minimum level. This creates market intransperency. Unfortunatley, this is the kind of intransperency that only benefits the big inverstors and corporations. They can sleeze their way into government programs and use this inside knowledge to make big gains. Those gains will be taken from retail investors, who will be the last ones to get the news about these kinds of deals.\n\n  \nAll these reasons have so far lead me to the conclusion to stay away from that market.

Elon's engineers convinced him to take a less ambitious approach with the Model Y.\n\nThe main issue I think with moving to a 50-60v architecture is that Tesla currently uses parts made for ICE vehicles, i.e. one example is the brake system made by Bosch. All of these parts use a 12v architecture. Tesla would need to replace all the external supplier parts with 60v ones (that don't exist). Their internal parts can be moved over more easily, but the external ones probably require massive orders before it makes sense for the supplier to invest in the R&D required.\n\nThere is also the CAN bus data system that needs to be updated. In the end, the car should be similar to your home network, with each part in the car connected to the 'network' and sending packets between devices for communication. There is also the possibility for 'wireless' vehicles where radio waves are used to transmit signals within the vehicles rather than cable, but this can be added in later.\n\nAs you can see the CAN and 12v architectures are kind of wedded together. Tesla can't just buy an off the shelf Bosch part and plug it into their ethernet 50-60v architecture. Tesla will need to use redesigned parts whose electronics have been redone to fit the new paradigm.\n\nOnce Tesla has the Berlin/Texas Phase 1's and Fremont/Shanghai fully ramped, Tesla will be making 2-3 million vehicles a year. At this point, I think Tesla could agree to a supply contract with Bosch or whoever make the 12v parts to make a 60v part. I think Tesla is also better placed than Legacy auto to move to this 'next gen' wire architecture because they make more parts in-house. Maybe Tesla also could co-engineer the part with them and take a small licensing fee.\n\nIt would be interesting to see how many electronically controlled parts exist in a Tesla that are off the shelf components.

These are two different things.\n\nTo get the FSD visualisations the cars would most likely need to be using the FSD stack. This would mean that if v10 software had the visualisation it would need to have everyone move to FSD v10. I think this will eventually happen.\n\nTesla will first prove-out v10 with their FSD beta testers. Roll out maybe 1 or 2 point releases, and then roll out the button. This is per Elon's recent comments. Everyone who downloads FSD v10 will get the visualisations.\n\nTesla at this point would have two main branches of Autopilot/FSD. If you haven't paid for FSD you get the old radar+vision legacy build. If you have FSD + click the button you get FSD v10. It shouldn't be long after this that Tesla will push the v10 stack to all radar + non-radar cars (without FSD).\n\nThen Tesla would basically have all USA vehicles on the FSD v10 Beta build, but only those who paid for FSD can use the FSD features. A lot of people forget that the only difference between normal FSD and FSD Beta v9 etc is the 'turning on city streets' functionality.\n\nThe other day another Tesla crashed into a police car that was parked on the side of the road. Considering the NHTSA investigation into this issue I think Tesla has a strong incentive to push the update to all vehicles in the USA. I'm sure the NHTSA would 'get off Tesla's back' if Tesla showed that the new update fixed the problem.\n\nI do agree that the visualisation will drive FSD sales, it's very cool and informative. Having all vehicles using the new v10 stack (and onwards iterations) should also increase the safety of the vehicles which will have a long term impact on sales. We might start to see accelerating declines in the quarterly accident rate.\n\nTLDR: Everyone will get the FSD visualisation when Tesla pushes the USA vehicles fleet to the v9/v10/v11 etc FSD Beta stack.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "> The other day another ~~Tesla~~ dumb ass driver crashed into a police car that was parked on the side of the road. \n\nFixed that part.\n\nAgree with the rest.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "At a mechanic now to get my old Toyota inspected.

Yes, inflation favours debt. This is not as good as you think:\n\n1. Rich people have a greater opportunity to get loans. And they do. It's a hedge agains inflation and rich people are buying up real estate and other assets against loans like crazy right now.\n2. Rich people can get more loans against their securities than poor people. If you borrow money against your home, the risk is that this particular home is going to loose value. If you borrow money against a portfolio of multiple homes in multiple locations, it is diversified and you can get a higher leverage for the same price.\n3. Poor people can only get a significant loan, if any, to buy a house or other asset. If they can weather out the inflation, they made a profit. But this is difficult. The value of the house goes up instantly with inflation. The rise in peoples income is, usually delayed, and might not fully compensate for inflation. So there is a window of opportunity for rich people to snatch up the assets of people who struggle because of inflation.\n4. Usually people only get a fixed interest loan on their house for a certain amount of time. After that, they have to refinance. Usually this is a good strategy, because by that time their house will have gained value and their lown will have gone down, making them eligable for more favorable interest rates. However, during an inflation interest rates go up and it might be harder to refinance. Especially since now your income might be much lower compared to the value of the house.\n5. Rich people get a loan, buy a house and rent it out. If they need some quick cash they can sell it. No skin off their back. Poor peole get a loan, buy a house and live in it. Aha, if the value of their house is so high because of inflation, why don't they sell it? Because then they won't have a place to live. Basically if they sell it, they have to find another house, which will be equally as expensive, and have to pay higher interest rates now, similar to the refinancing case. Or they take the cash and now have to pay rent every month, which leaves them without any assets. Mortgage payments are an investment, rent is not.\n6. Banks are not the ones that loose money when loans default. They sell those loans on to other investors, typically big institutional investors like retirement funds or insurances. Retirement funds and insurances for the poor, of course. So collectivley, poor people are bearing their own risk. And if those funds go belly up and too many rich people get affected, those funds will be bailed out by govt. money, aka poor peoples money (rich people don't pay taxes).\n\nSo i think inflation fucks poor people disproportionately, but I might be wrong, I am just an ape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\n>Higher than average inflation would be a good thing, but the wealthy won’t let it happen.\n\nYes, they are doing it right now.

{"title": "CRSR: The Play of a Century", "selftext": "What's up retards, I have spent the past 2 WEEKS finding the best stock play to make YOU RICH, and it looks like CRSR is ready to go to the MOON!\n\nNO MORE will your wife’s boyfriend bully you for your micro-penis! After CRSR you will be rich enough to get penis-enlargement surgery and FINALLY have a dong BIGGER than his!!!\n\nNow before you retards go gamble all your life savings on the chance to get penis-enlargement surgery, let me explain why CRSR will go TO THE MOOON\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First, the Fundamentals:**\n\nNow bare with me, I know you retards don’t like fundamentals… So I will make it as short and colorful as possible!\n\nFundamentally, this company is one of the MOST undervalued companies I have EVER seen\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mznix9b2uhk71.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=c29960c932cbd9af0f993eaaf0b124f918960fac\n\nCRSR has grown at 24.3% Y/Y despite chip shortages, re-openings, supply-chain shocks, commodity inflation, and last year being especially good for them cause of lockdowns\n\nThey also own Elgato which specializes in studio equipment for streamers, and Origin PC which builds custom pc’s\n\nThese two additional companies have been growing rapidly and allow CRSR to capture the whole gaming peripheral market\n\nDespite being a well run, profitable company in a growing industry, they are priced at HALF the S&P 500's P/E!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izz273f4uhk71.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe189f52a2c6e4b7afd394465e64fb915cc0320\n\nAdditionally the float is only around 88M... so unlike some plays on here, WSB could LITERALLY buy the ENTIRE FLOAT\n\nI could go on for SO much longer about why CRSR is a Deep F\\*cking Value play... But since you retards have an attention-span worse than a goldfish, I will move on...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Option Chains:**\n\nCorsair has an insanely bullish options market which is primed for a Gamma Squeeze\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3778p8t6uhk71.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9838491bb87c9d27bdacb7759ff9fe87f37ae5\n\nIf CRSR gets above $35.00 by 9/17, up to 2,037,800 shares will need to be purchased! This is even before WSB has gotten their greasy hands on it. I’m sure by 9/17 the open interest will be MUCH higher\n\nHaving so many options sold just OTM is PERFECT for a gamma squeeze\n\nAdditionally due to delta hedging, the more IV on options and options that go ITM, the more stocks MM's will need to buy to hedge against the options that they sold\n\nHaving so many options contracts sold on a smaller market cap stock is perfect for a gamma squeeze. IV will go through the roof once WSB buys in causing MM's to hedge creating a feedback loop\n\nCRSR options are SUPER cheap which gives a good entry point for WSB retards, and makes it much easier to increase the open interest\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short sellers:**\n\nOver the past month, short sellers have been getting TOO greedy and have been adding a shit ton of positions around 26$. This means shorts will be underwater if the stock price increases AT ALL\n\nCRSR has a short interest of around 24% which, albeit still large, would not be a huge issue on its own... but because most of these short positions were opened at the literal bottom, those short sellers will be much more likely to close their positions and/or be margin called\n\nFor the past few weeks, around 40% of the volume has been sold short\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9foib1cuhk71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd43fab041475611218d946812efb0dc47a2d786\n\nAt the same time as shorts have been adding positions, large institutional investors have been buying in HEAVILY\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7284jjduhk71.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=22a94571d7c932f4439a5587301cbcfca8fc41ff\n\nThis high of a short interest combined with strong financials, a bullish options market, and large institutional investors being on our side means shorts are absolutely fucked and this stock is going TO THE MOON\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to Profit:**\n\nI recommend buying a mix of 9/17 ITM/OTM calls, leaps, and shares\n\nBuy 9/17 calls if you believe this has a chance to squeeze\n\nBuy leaps/shares if you believe in the underlying company\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\n10 $27.5 C 9/17, 13 $30 C 9/17, 50 $32.5 C 9/17, 20 $35 C 9/17, 106 shares, 2 $25 2/18/22 C\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1dcgm1iuhk71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=15cd932f87fe52287b37262ec396341363afc910", "id": "pehp2m", "created_utc": 1630328741.0, "score": 3364, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 980, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|671|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pehp2m/crsr_the_play_of_a_century/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Tell me why I instantly pictured you starting this monologue out of breathe and sweaty??", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "To the fucking moon", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Your chart reminds me of an ascending dong wedge and I've had success sitting on them and riding until the bulls empty their gains in me", "score": 569, "replies": [{"body": "For some reason my \"after buying Corsair\" chart looks like the before buying Corsair chart.", "score": 137, "replies": [{"body": "Same, bought at 37.50 during the last WSB \"Corsair is super undervalued and will moon!\" pump", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "This.

I think even Warren Buffet would move into a cardboard box next door to you and explain that sold everything he has for apple shares if it \"crashed\" by 40% or more right now.\n\nWhich brings me to my point. For those massive companies with inflated market caps to crash, there has to be some kind of Earth shattering event that would make even the diamondiest of hands afraid to touch them. Not \"hey man, apple is making me too much money, think I'm gonna sell it for some bonds instead\". I'm talking a pandemic that shuts down the whole world's economy, several gigantic banks going out of business, fucking meteors falling out of the sky, Yellowstone erupting, that's what has to happen for people to start selling their blue chipped shares and for the market to crash. It will happen from time to time, but it can't be predicted by number crunching on a chart.
