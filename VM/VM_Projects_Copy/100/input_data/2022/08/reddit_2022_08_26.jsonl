Here’s a list of the problems. \n\n- Down 16% in DataCenter/Ai while everyone else grew. Was selling these Datacenter chips which typically are very high margin chips at 5% margin. Meaning they were essentially giving them away for cheap. \n\n- Amd in Datacenter/server will be releasing Genoa in Q4 which is their new chip. This is important because Sapphire Rapids (Intels new Datacenter chip) has been delayed until late February of this coming year and was supposed to compete will Milian (AMD’s current chip). \n\n- For the next 8 months Amd and other competitors will be taking lots of market share from Intel in the Datacenter chip space. Especially AMD being essentially 2 gens ahead for like 2-3 months in Q4. \n\n- Sapphire Rapids might be dead on arrival. \n\n- New chip plants are cool and all. They also take a shitload of money to build even with the Chips act with how many they are building and size there will definitely be big cost. \n\n- It will take 3-4 years for most of these chip plants to be built and be operational. \n\n- Samsung and TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor) are  very far ahead in that space producing chips & other products for others. Very far ahead. \n\n- Intel’s new desktop Gpu’s at the worst time possible to sell GPU’s (after a crypto crash) have come out or at least the lower end sku has. \n\n- Arc A380 their desktop graphics card has a bunch of problems and compared to other offerings from Nvidia & AMD it doesn’t really have a ton of buyers.

{"title": "Fed’s Powell, in blunt remarks at Jackson Hole, says bringing down inflation will cause pain to households and businesses", "selftext": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell used the spotlight on the central bank’s Jackson Hole retreat to deliver a blunt message that the Fed will keep at the job of bringing inflation down until it is done and that the fight will be costly in terms of jobs and economic growth. “Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,” Powell said in his speech to the central bankers and economists gathered at the base of the Grand Tetons.\n\n“Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he added. Fed Chairmen often give the opening address to the Fed’s Jackson Hole retreat in late August. While many of the speeches have been consequential for markets, they have also tended to be long and wide-ranging. Powell broke the mold with his speech Friday with a short six-page speech.\n\nIn it, Powell drove home the point that the Fed has an “overarching focus right now to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal.” “We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored. We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done,” Powell said.\n\nOn worries about a possible recession, Powell said that he sees “strong underlying momentum” in the economy. Powell said he was pleased with the lower July inflation readings but quickly added “a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.” At the moment, “high inflation has continued to spread through the economy,”\n\nPowell kept the door open for a 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike in September, saying that “another unusually large increase could be appropriate” next month. But he said the debate over whether to hike by 0.75 percentage point for the third straight meeting or slow to a half percentage point increase would depend on the “totality” of the economic data between now and the Fed’s Sept. 20 meeting. At some point, the Fed won’t be able to keep raising by 0.75 percentage point moves, he added. Wall Street had viewed Powell’s last press conference in July as dovish. Analysts said that this view came when Powell described the Fed’s benchmark interest rate setting – in a range of 2.25%-2.5% – as “neutral.” Perhaps in a nod to the markets view, Powell said in his speech Friday that neutral “was not a place to stop or pause” rate hikes.\n\n**Full speech here-** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-powell-in-blunt-remarks-at-jackson-hole-says-bringing-down-inflation-will-cause-pain-to-households-and-businesses-11661522428?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-powell-in-blunt-remarks-at-jackson-hole-says-bringing-down-inflation-will-cause-pain-to-households-and-businesses-11661522428?mod=home-page)", "id": "wyakwv", "created_utc": 1661523929.0, "score": 1945, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 772, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Every day there are still boomers and late gen-x'ers retiring. With as much QE that took place, there's a shit load of cash out there, especially underneath wealthy and super wealthy individuals' asses. With rates going up, of course the market's going to take a dump when non-retail and the smarter retail can get better returns and yields outside of the stock market.\n\nWe're seeing inflation, but this is because wealthy people still have cash to throw around to get their hands on tightened supply. While working class and petit bourgeois might be feeling the heat as costs go up, the labour aristocracy and bourgeoisie can still afford the price increase that have come with inflation, so demand (in certain sectors) hasn't taken all too much of a hit. So even as rates increase and debt servicing because more expensive, I don't personally think revenues will take as hard of a hit as jpow is wanting to see. The way I see it is either:\n\n- Businesses go to skeleton crews to cut fat and costs to make the hit to profit not as bad, but the absences left by an aging (and dying) managerial class will induce a demand for new labour at cheaper labour costs *compared* to the aging out managerial class' labour cost. And if the labour costs don't go down, the skeleton crews and decreased output from big players will be new opportunities for competition either by new players entering sectors, mergers between players, or acquisitions of smaller players by bigger players at cheaper prices than two years ago. With higher rates, I see inflation calming down but joblessness not necessarily increasing for as long or as large in magnitude as jpow is expecting. Markets will go up and down, but the economy will still chug along without too much of a hiccup, there's still just way too much fiat out there for the economy to completely choke.\n\n- or, revenues take a slight dip, but the change in labour market just means labour shifts around. Underemployed, university educated people are hopping jobs sector to sector, filling in roles left absent from retirees or people who died from covid. People who had no education left the market to go get new skills in demand by the economy. And even if lay offs start happening, in aggregate, there are still a lot of labour opportunities left unfilled since the worst of the pandemic that still need hands-on-deck.\n\nJPow's working within orthodoxy during an age where data and information have never been more accessible and analyzed which allows for better leveraged decision making in the micro while generating new labour opportunities. I think orthodoxy can advise decision making, but I don't think orthodoxy is as good at *predicting* the results of its decision-making as it may have once been. I work in data analytics and I'm seeing endless job opportunities pop up and my own company unable to retain talent and then postings for replacements go unanswered. Sure, some sectors and departments are hurting and needing to plan corporate re-orgs, but that doesn't necessarily mean joblessness will follow. I'm personally more frightful of jpow overreacting and outright chasing an increase of joblessness because he assumes that's the only way to deal with this situation is to *cause* joblessness, but I think he might be fighting a losing battle with the shifts that have taken place.\n\nWhat this means for equities markets? I have no fucking clue, this is just one imbecile's take. If the economy laughs in the face of jpow's expectations while inflation goes back to 2%, I think things will chug along right back into equities as returns and yields outside of the stock market choke up. If Jpow thinks fucking up the labour market more is the most important thing to do and things go awry, :shrugs:.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "I think they’re expecting economic tightening to bring some people back into the labor market fold that were in the “not seeking employment” group.\n\nWe could see a strange 12 months where unemployment stays flat but labor force participation starts going back up, increasing the overall labor pool and creating downward wage pressure.

In Belgium all the energy that goes back is either free for the energy companies or if you have a teller that turns back, you have to pay hundreds of euros for having solar panels, at best you pay a whole bunch for the privilege of giving electricity to energy company. Everything extra you produce goes into their pockets and you pay according to the size of your installation, so 5kWp costs more than 3kWp, they are incentivising not having solar or when you do to have an underpowered inverter so you don't have to pay too much, waisting renewable energy.\n\nI think in the Netherlands, they are no longer allowed to send energy back into the grid, so they can only use the energy when the sun is out themselves but most is just lost because if your car isn't charging when the sun is out it's hard to use kW's of energy and people are at work when the sun is out.\n\nYou at least get some money for it, they are not incentivising to either not get solar or when you do get a small installation while waisting the energy.\n\nI'm not saying your situation is good, but comparatively it's a lot better.\n\nI have to ad, with the increase in costs of electricity solar panels are now more attractive, because the price you pay for the privilege of having solar panels, was calculated some time ago, but I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to increase that price by an equal amount.

So that give some redundancy if either something goes wrong with part of solar panels or one of the inverters.(SMA inverters not available, I waited for 2 months to replace last inverter that broke, company said it would take 4 weeks to deliver new SMA 5kWp. After 9 weeks I called and they said it would be December at earliest, . I contacted SMA Europe to ask when they would become available, they said they couldn't help me and December was probably earliest I could hope for, this was in April)\n\nI'm happy with current 5kW solax inverter, good site to monitor too, but I would still prefer SMA.\n\nFor batteries I want to buy 10 x BYD BATTERY HVM 22.1 AT 22.1KWH HIGH VOLTAGE.

I'm counting on October and November to dazzle with numbers and maybe a good AI day (hasn't moved sp much in the past though) combined with Twitter deal falling through.

Simply because those systems were not designed to reach such amounts. The installer will know better, of course. \n\nI ended up having the photovoltaic system completely separated from the battery system, each with their inverters.

If you go frame by frame at the beginning you can see that they drive it directly over a big rock, which looks like it then gets stuck between the car and the ramp (the ramp designed to flip a car) and bounces back in to the bottom of the car. They're basically using a huge wedge to drive a small boulder in to the battery pack, over and over again.\n\nThe car flips (as designed, by the car flipping ramp) and at least one of the cells was damaged. About 10 seconds after the crash that damage cell catches fire, blows the safety vent and shoots fire out of the bottom of the car, then it looks like at least one more cell goes about 5-10 seconds after that. Which is exactly what's supposed to happen? Damaged cells that catch fire vent the pressure out the bottom, in a safe direction, so that hopefully thermal runaway doesn't spread to other cells.\n\nGiven that this test seemed designed to puncture the battery pack and flip the car, the fact that the car flip and at least two cells caught fire doesn't seem like a very surprising result to me?

It's not like I'm some overly optimistic bull.  I even sold 1200CCs - 2200CCs against all my shares and LEAPs around April this year.   (bought back in early July) \n\nThat all being established,  If you look at the current options chains and some reasonable models you'll see that we are kind of getting to a point where there isn't a lot of sense to be made.   As an example,  $758.33 Jun 24 is the furthest out, highest price call that can be bought,  or just under $2300 pre split.   Tesla was at 1200 in 2021,  and in the 3 interim years we are growing 50%+ YoY with no signs of stopping or slowing as has been reiterated by the company.  That,  even with economy slowing and PE compression,  easily puts us around 2500/sh by mid 2024 pre split.   If you wanted to be pretty bullish you could justify over 3k/sh pre split (1000 post) in mid 2024.  Just look at some models and tell me I'm wrong.   Current risk of options based on their pricing and what strikes are available is highly skewed to the upside.\n\n.. \n\nI don't claim to be some expert modeler or even the smartest person around... and I've definitely learned some hard lessons along the way.   I don't even really spreadsheet my own models,  so I'm a giant nobody that you could easily dismiss and quite honestly-  maybe you should.   I'm a fucktard of the hugest order and I've definitely lost a lot of money and opportunities all while I also 20X'd my Tesla portfolio.   (probably could have 50X'd+ it with just a few smart moves like not paper handing 1200Cs on the COVID dip for example) \n\nI do take in a shit load of information including many models and I balance it all against some risky scenarios with a generally pessimistic world view.  On top of all this, I've been in and followed Tesla since 2016...  I know opportunity when I see it. Go ahead and be cautiously optimistic/bearish and figure 600/sh in mid 2024.  The opportunity is still tremendous.   If you ignore the possibilities presented above,  I'm telling you that even factoring in worst case scenarios you could be making a huge mistake. \n\nAll opportunity requires some level of risk taking.  For most people,  a few thousand dollars is a mistake you can recover from- especially if you're young.   Also for most people,  a six figure pay day or 10x type returns is something you rarely get the opportunity to take advantage of.   That's the risk taking I'm advocating for here in this post,  and in my post below.

Lower rates allowed people to afford a larger mortgage and since there was a shortage of houses, prices rocketed up to meet where home buyers could afford. Too many dollars chasing too few goods. \n\nThe property around me has gone up like 50-100% in 2-3 years during the pandemic and associated factors. Housing prices are largely dynamic (each property sold changes comps for the area) where renters have leases that lock them in for a year or more.

It’s unhealthy to speculate anything past 2-3 years as there’s too many variables that can change to me. \n\nIt’s also too hard to figure out what kind of multiple the market is going to give or be willing to pay for with ongoing macro issues. So I play my options and expectations to be more moderate and choose strikes closer to have a higher probability of success while decreasing my risk in case things go tits up again.\n\nEveryone has their own way of investing and expectations.

It's one thing if you want to just use the raw output with some filters or heuristic or something, that might be good enough for lidar to say \"there's something in the road\". But if you want to use sensors to distinguish between a pedestrian and a bush or a plastic bag, then you need to start labeling the data, and that seems like it could be *a lot* of work.\n\nLike, labeling an image is pretty straightforward, people can just look at it and recognize objects and draw boxes. Labeling video needs some kind of specialized tools to make it go faster, but you need to feed good data in to those tools first to get them working. And then something like radar or lidar seems like it would be very unintuitive for people to label. It seems like it could very easily take a long time and be more error-prone, even with customized tools.\n\nEspecially with lidar or radar and issues like reflections or dust or rain or stuff like that. It's not immediately clear what the best way to label the data is to train the NN's to recognize the objects and ignore the noise. I'm sure it's possible, it's just a question of how long it takes and how easy/hard it is to make and fix errors.\n\nWhat if the radar data is way noisier, or takes a lot long to clean and label? What if it's much easier to make a mistake and miss it? You might be slowing down the whole project to add in data that's just going to get zero weights in the NNs.\n\nBut, if you can develop one set of sensors to a high level (probably lidar or vison first), and you can trust it to be accurate, then it starts to get a lot easier to add more sensors. You can add radar and see where the vision and radar disagree, and since you can trust vision, you can use that data to fix the radar labeling. And through that process you'll probably eventually discover certain situations, probably low visibility situations, where radar catches things further away or increases the confidence or something like that. And then you can add it in when needed, but I don't know if it'll be possible to identify that point until you've got one set of sensors working very reliably. \n\nI suspect that at the heart of it, data labeling is why self driving seems to have so many \"local maximums\".

I think that is probably solvable by including simulator data.

But the real issue is what to do when the two disagree, if there's snow or fog or dust or something that would make the automatic mapping between the two really messy. So you want to train a NN to take all that messy data in to account, but that probably means having humans manually label 3d point clouds to identify real objects vs \"atmospheric\" reflections.\n\nGoogle showed off a NN that could filter out snow and rain, but they had a talk about it years ago, and I haven't seen anything to indicate that it's working well enough that they could use it for real world driving yet. That's potentially because creating a diverse real world data set for that is a very laborious task.\n\n> over the wishes of the FSD team... I'm assuming it was a supply/cost issue, not because there was a real technical issue the team couldn't surmount.\n\nI mean, that's certainly one possibility. I'd think it's at least as likely that Musk really did think it was leading to a local maximum that was hard to get out of. And the fact that the FSD team doesn't want radar back, and that they've made a ton of great progress since then, might be signs that it was a good technical choice?\n\nEventually Tesla might end up bringing radar back, hell they might even start using lidar eventually if they end up in a spot where there's a benefit. I just think that there's a good chance that getting one set of sensors to perform really well, using a large labeled data set of real world driving, is probably the best strategy to avoid local maximums.

{"title": "Why you should be bullish on GameStop's NFT marketplace.", "selftext": " I've been into NFTs for quite some time now and have been following GameStop's marketplace roll out closely, below I will give some insight into what I think sets it apart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Minting Process:***\n\nGameStop’s mint process is akin to a “secondary” purchase as experienced NFT purchasers know it. Admittedly when I first saw this I found it strange, but later realized it’s important to remember a hefty percentage of GameStop’s audience has never purchased an NFT before.\n\nGameStop's marketplace keeps everything bare bones simplified and focuses on Web 2.0 consumer experience. So, let’s say I want to mint “X” NFT on GameStop, all I need to know is when they mint because the mint takes place on the GameStop site. I also do not need anything extra for gas due to how GameStop structures their mints, all NFTs are pre-minted!\n\nWhy is this crucial…? If the future of NFTs is gaming & scaling to hundreds of thousands of NFTs per collection then we need an efficient way to mint & transact them, GameStop solved this with their Immutable X & Loopring partnerships allowing projects to pre-mint their collections for just a few dollars.\n\nThis means no more $20,000,000 fuck ups like Gary Vee’s brother had with the “Vayner Sports Pass” where they literally just burned millions worth of liquidity in fees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Power to the Players… Literally:***\n\nThe decade and a half old motto has aged exquisitely following the marketplace release, with games like Illuvium, Gods Unchained, and more coming soon we can already see proof of concept. Not only will we be seeing great games onboarded soon, but what better brand is there other than GameStop to be positioned on the forefront of onboarding gamers to Web 3.0?\n\nGameStop moving into the NFT space restores “Power to the Players” through true ownership of digital assets. Today we play games like Fortnite for Ex. and buy skins that we can’t trade, have no IP rights, and ultimately don’t really own... There’re hundreds of other games that follow this same model, Fortnite just happens to be one of the most prolific.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Volume, volume, volume:***\n\nThis doesn’t really fit under what I think sets the marketplace apart, however I see way too many posts about the low Vol. It’s a beta and what you see on the marketplace currently is not the core vision of what the GameStop marketplace will have to offer.\n\nMajority of the projects on there are just art /community centric and have no utility, so before screaming about low volume look a few months into the future when awesome games that have millions of NFTs are trading on GameStop marketplace. Perspective is everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Community:***\n\nOne of the most difficult arts to master in the NFT space is cultivating a strong community, GameStop not only has a community of gamers, but apes that have banded together amid opposition.\n\nI can’t stress enough how big of a leg up this is, you guys aren’t just bringing an already established community closer, you’re also enticing buyers like myself that typically trade on L1’s to check out the GameStop NFT ecosystem.\n\n***Conclusion:***\n\nGameStop’s NFT marketplace in my eyes is everything the leading “Gaming” focused marketplace should be, sure we need some fundamentals like filters, mint limits, etc. but it’s a beta. If you’re still on the fence I’d implore you to watch as the games are onboarded and the “Power to the Players” motto is seen to fruition!", "id": "wxu9ff", "created_utc": 1661473585.0, "score": 881, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 514, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wxu9ff)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wxu9ff)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I just don’t get the appeal of NFTs.

I used to play a game in high-school called Dota 2 it's developed by valve who run the steam marketplace on PC. Now valve sells lootboxes and runs tournaments where can obtain in-game items that you equip to various characters etc, they don't do anything to enhance your abilities in-game, but they are cool to work for and collect and flex with. The cool thing about steam is that I can actually sell any ingame items I've obtained on their marketplace for cash. Except it's only usable on their marketplace. That's the downside. So just to give you an idea of how serious this market is, ill tell you my experience. About ten years ago I was in a tournament and won these swords for a character in-game that does nothing for the character but make him look badass and epic. The swords were only attainable in that tournament if you reached a crazy high rank. So supply was limited back then and today they are impossible to earn or obtain in any way, but the last time I checked the marketplace to see how much these specific swords were going for I'd seen the last 3 sales were for over $1600.

That's what Gamestop is doing. \n\n\nAlso something VERY IMPORTANT that op is forgetting is the explanation to why every game developer will soon be fighting to get on board. Why? Money. That's why. When a company like EA sells a Halloween themed skin for Call of Duty warzone to me, that's it. They've made $20 from that sale and will never see another dime off that sale again. But the way NFTs work is that the original minter(creator) of the NFT will get a cut of every sale that the NFT goes through, forever as long as people are still trading it. So they could sell me a limited edition skin of say Freddy Kruger on Halloween for $20 and then a few months later after its off the market I sell it to some Nightmare on Elm Street fan for $30, then a year later that guy needs some cash to buy a new game and he sells that skin for say $25 etc who knows, point is EA will get a cut of each Sale.

You’re talking about firms competing with each other for certain resources, which is not the same thing at all as what we’re discussing, which is competition for consumers.\n\nHere, let me try to illustrate for you with an example. Let’s say I’m selling donuts. I’m the only person in town that sells donuts, so I use a complex formula to determine that the ideal price to maximize my profits is $2/donut. They only cost $0.50 to make, but I’ve determined the best way to maximize my profits is by charging exactly $2 per donut.\n\nNow, someone new comes along and opens up a second donut shop in town. Their donuts are exactly the same as mine in terms of cost and quality, but everyone’s used to coming to my donut shop, so their business struggles out of the gate, so what do they do to differentiate themselves? They lower the prices of their donuts.\n\nInstead of trying to compete with me at the same price point, they lower the price of their donuts to $1.50. Sure, they only get $1 in profit from each donut instead of the $1.50 in profit they’d get from charging $2, but they had to stand out somehow to  win a larger share of the market.\n\nNow I’m in a tough spot. I’m starting to lose more and more customers each day because they’re going for these lower-priced donuts across town, so what do I do? Well, if I wanna win them back, I gotta drop my prices down to $1.25 per donut.\n\nDo you see how that works now? Without competition, I could sit, fat and happy, and charge whatever I pleased. But with competition in the way, I’ve suddenly gotta lower my prices to make my products stand out. Seriously, I recommend taking a microeconomics course or reading a book on it. It’s a really interesting field, and it’ll help you understand all of this a bit better.\n\n> And in game stores aren’t really a traditional monopoly, because there are no competitors\n\nI’m so confused by this comment. That’s literally the exact definition of a monopoly.\n\n> they don’t have to sacrifice this “monopoly”\n\nOk, wait, we’re talking about NFTs here, right? Isn’t the whole point of NFTs that people who buy them can then resell them? And if there’s now more people selling a product, how is that not competition?\n\nAll the stuff you’re saying about selling it from different apps and stuff is fine, but what does that have to do with NFTs? Couldn’t they do all of that stuff (streamer-sponsored skins, selling from other apps or marketplaces, etc.) without having to sell the skins as NFTs?\n\nFortnite selling their skins through Amazon still allows them to partner with Amazon to control the price and set it where they want it.

Players who bought also didn't need to keep buying.  Blizzard made some money on each transaction, but the transactions kept slowing down until it simply wasn't profitable.  They made a marketplace for digital items and destroyed the game because of it, all to try to squeeze a little bit of extra cash from players who ultimately weren't having fun and were leaving.\n\nThis is what this kind of NFT is aiming to do, and it doesn't even have a huge IP like Diablo behind it.

{"title": "8-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Weekly market Analysis", "selftext": " Well today a lot of people realize they had a plan for “what if JPOW rallies us 3% to 430” but not many of us had a “what if JPOW tanks us 3% and we see 405 today?”\n\nToday will probably go down as one of the wildest trading days ive seen in a while. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5db8q2ul4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e1df8a25dda33f5c1b30aa2d06e57b3248072d\n\nThat 10am candle opened dropped nearly $4… recovered $4 almost and then started the sell off with a bigger sell off after it. That candle was even more dramatic then most FOMC moves are. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d8stolul4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc4b7f14c17542e6977d483c4a7170495f4818f9\n\nToday we closed out at almost 102 mil volume which is about 160% of the 30day average. This is a massive volume day and is the highest volume since June 30th which was 112mil. Usually we consider large volume days to be bearish days. So this type of volume really could be signaling something much bigger is coming downside wise. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aw9j9l3vl4k91.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=90f229817d1a67bd2c881d86c78b7831dba2798b\n\nOkay so where are we at? \n\nAs of this morning I was working under the assumption of us trading within that blue downward channel, however, as you can see we broke through that end of day today. \n\nThe big things that happen is we broke back through the daily 8, 200, 20, 100 and 50ema… so we now have closed below all of those levels. Being back below all the EMAs hasn’t happened since the lows of July. \n\nWe broke through key level support of 417.5 and from there we bounced and closed right on the next level support of 405.2. I mentioned we should start playing level to level. So breaking 417.5 we should have expected 405.2 (of course not in the same day… ) but if and when we break and close below 405.2 I will look for 391 as our next major support for a bounce. However, if we double bottom at 405.2 we could start back toward 417.5.\n\nThe daily candle is a massive bearish engulfing candle that not only engulfed the previous days candle but the whole week and 62% of this whole months trading range.\n\nWe did not completely fill the 421.22 gap this morning as we only reached 419.96 before we saw the major downturn at 10am. The next gap below is down to 378.57.\n\nSo something interesting that I mentioned earlier this week is that…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zduc1apvl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=861bc3d5a9f26ff6bd12ef218d7149f4197c4166\n\nIf we are assuming August 16th and 431.73 is the ultimate top of the bear market rally we should look for 374.3 and September 16th as the next possible bottom. However we could see a range anywhere from 388.5 to 362.6. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o29oqibwl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0375e1d20d2c0aa7246d10bb19fbb24a0fccb47\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvlq9nvwl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3067f40164283c9858da918d847b749754a4e4f\n\nFun fact… Cpi is on September 13th too and the next FOMC meeting is September 20th. There is a potential that we could see the next big bear market sell off and it could lead us right into CPI/ FOMC or those could be what takes us to the bottom. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xhpn0exl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=548310d293b9559d62432aa15cc20740e99d65b0\n\nInterestingly enough on SPY weekly we did not break through the 11 week long bull channel. We actually bounce just short of support which woulda been right at the weekly 100ema of 404.2. However, unless SPY plans to open over 409.91 (1.1% green) and never lose that support all week we will see that level broken on Monday. That would be the confirmation we need to suspect the next level down. \n\nMajor supports to watch next week-\n\n405.2 (daily level) -> 404.2 (weekly 100ema) -> 390 (weekly and daily support level) \n\nMajor resistance to watch next week-\n\n407.5 (daily 50ema) -> 412.7 (weekly resistance level) -> 417.5 (daily resistance level)\n\nMy overall thoughts are if we close below 405 on Monday that its safe to assume we see 390 before 417.5 again. If we hold 405 then we might try and retake 417.5 first. The most likely scenario for Monday is an “inside day” where we trade within the previous days range and then Tuesday make a big move. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vej1lzxl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb7be6a5ca875e672678251a16358203a3acc31\n\nFutures daily is the same story we broken through all the levels and closed back below all the EMAs for first time since the lows of July. \n\nKey support- 4020 -> 3922 -> 3865\n\nKey resistance- 4075 -> 4100 -> 4130 -> 4157\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i47vemmyl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=68bceb205336886e032e90027b2340d50922101e\n\nFutures weekly actually did hit the 11 week long bull support line and did as of right now break the weekly 100ema of 4050. Again unless futures opens big green Monday and hold 4092 all day long and week long we will be through support which should signify a confirmed downward move towards 3906.\n\nKey weekly support- 3906\n\nKey weekly resistance- 4112\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cj9bdv9zl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=943e85f54a32d328d7bb51b199bea09b3d2bc9ee\n\nA lot going on here with Apple so they closed with about 79mil volume which is the largest volume day since August 17th (the peak). Apple also had the reddest close since June 16th (the bottom). \n\nI was watching a potential black bull channel within the bigger red bull channel but we fell through that support. I was also watching a blue bear channel that we also fell through that support. \n\nSo lets clean up this chart. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgxi83xzl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f402fb3dcb39f51a1be46f7601ea7d27382e43a\n\nAs of right now the “potential” bull channel resistance using the June 8th and August 17th high with the Low of June 16th and June 30th for support we have a potential down side for Friday at 158 for Apple. \n\nApple also closed back below its Daily 8 and 20ema. Apple almost filled its upped gap leaving about 25 cents there (that could be considered filled tho) and it also filled its lower gap today. The next gap on apple is at 157.64 and should be a potential target for next week. \n\nIf we start to breakout upward we will look to that blue resistance line now established for rejection. \n\nKey daily support- 163.2 -> 160.8 -> 158.1 -> 155.5\n\nKey daily resistance- 164.9 -> 167.5 -> 168.7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xgej7o0m4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe08854cf31bf1ee1e3a52f9e145067225e04cc\n\nThe apple weekly actually gives a pretty good breakdown of where things are headed. \n\nThe weekly gap is almost filled and would be okay to go unfilled the rest of the way. From here we should test the red bull channel support at 154 next week. Once we would lose 154 it should a clear down side to 120s/ 130s. \n\nKey weekly support- 161 -> 157.5 -> 154.1\n\nKey weekly resistance- 166.5 -> 172.2 -> 176.2\n\nI actually really like Apple for a level to level play also here using these weekly levels. So once 161 breaks look for 157.4. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6vluda1m4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b498a54e2ca44011a7dbf44361e4ade187439b8a\n\nThe VIX is the true winner today with a crazy 17.26% day. The VIX broke through all the major resistance levels and closed back in the 25.5 to 34.7 zone. If this can hold this level on Monday I would look for VIX to take us to 34.7 and eventually take SPY back to 360s/370s. \n\nHowever, if VIX were to lose 25.5 on Monday or any day next week then we will look for it to end up back in the green zone form 18.7 to 25.5.\n\nSo you guys are probably asking whats the play? What would I do? Am I long or short on anything? \n\nWell honestly I wouldn’t open or hold anything after a massive -3.4% day like this. You have to think about it like this… I know many of you were in 30 and 60dte puts and I know many of those were up 200-500% depending on when you opened it. \n\nWould you rather close out a 200% gainer and open a new position (of the same size) for pretty much free (since your win paid for it) or would you rather hold till Monday and take the chance the markets slap the bear and we get a 3% green day and erase everything that happened today? You HAVE to secure profits. You can not let profits like that slip away. \n\nWe are meeting the criteria that makes me think we are going to see the next major sell off. The one thing that will continue to hold me up is “what is the catalyst for the sell off to continue?” Markets have known all of this info for months now and now all of a sudden they wanna act shocked? Is this just a massive over reaction and now we rally till CPI actually gives us a selling point followed by FOMC or is this actually the start of the next sell off? \n\nI am not someone who enjoys swings because I feel like my timing is never quite there (yes I know I can predict things pretty well but seems like whenever I take a long swing im early or way late…). The better play here is to wait for bottom and then play the rise back up with calls. Market will naturally and way more aggressively rise. Markets need a reason to sell off though. \n\nBut the play I would consider is VIX >$25, SPY < $405 and Apple < $163 on Monday at market close and we should expect to see VIX 30, SPY $390 and Apple $155-158 within the next week or two. \n\n10% Challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3aucqxy1m4k91.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb5cc962ba2d74bd8d8152b9ebccdd55505a863f\n\nThis week for me felt like one of those weeks where you just beat yourself. I had two trades this week that I let go red. I also had two trades that TOS screwed me on (one was a 15% stop limit that didn’t fill and the other was a 8% winner then filled at -1%). Thats four winners I should have had this week (not excuses but that’s how I look at it). Had I gotten those 4 winners (2 definitely my fault) I would have ended up with 88% win rate and at least $1000 this week. I beat myself this week is how I see it. \n\nBut next week is a new week and Monday is a new day to do better. \n\nThis market is chewing up and spitting people out left and right. This market is all about capital preservation. We have to think long term. 2022 is probably the hardest market any of us will trade in and probably the hardest day trading we will do for the rest of our careers. If you can survive 2022 profitable or not… but just don’t capitulate out… you will someday be hella prosperous. This is a marathon not a sprint! \n\nYoutube will be up late tonight.. having a movie night with the kiddos!
