He still should have known and after he thought about I bet he remembered. \n\n   But his point was still correct.  The government over spent and went a long way to creating this problem we have today.   especially the second huge stimulus. And  the red dress economist does little to help the history of the situation by playing the poor vs rich card.  Her myopic account of no one caring about the fed propping up rich investors and only being mad at the government helping people get food  makes me wonder just how much she knows about economics and that short peace of history in the first place. \n\n   Many people complained about the supposed wall street rich people  bail out Right along with the complaints and warnings about the possible long term consequences of the individual payouts. I'm not going to say if either one was wrong or right but many many people warned about both.  \n\n  But if I had to choose which one may have been more temporarily necessary I would say the the move to prop up securities and  the bond market was much more important.

We live  with a complicated system of monetary policy where so many things are tied together.

It in fact did little good and js now causing great harm.\n\nBUT during that same time what would have happened if there was a complete collapse of the entire business system? It could have been far worse than it was.

It incentivizes the creation of money.\n\nGovernment spending also creates money, because the government has to borrow that money into existence.\n\n\nEDIT:   Look, when a the Federal Reserve purchases a security, say a 10-year Treasury Note, through QE operations from a bank.  They are purchasing money which has ALREADY been created.  And they give the bank cash.   The Fed then hopes that the bank will use that cash to create more loans - which is creating money.  But until the bank creates more loans, then no new money has been created via QE.   If you want an accurate measure of how money was created; you'd look at bank loans and credit over a specific period (combined with government debt issued.)\n\nThe 10-year note is turned into a reserve asset, and is basically removed from the monetary supply.

The FED has actually CUT money supply, which is obviously implied with QT, however, that makes me believe that the USD is something that is becoming more scarce (relatively speaking of course). Typically, I believe it take about 3-6 months for each hike the fed does to really take its effect on the actual economy, so you figure the most recent 75 basis point hike is going to have its effect in the late fall / early winter time. The 75 basis point hike they are about to do, I believe this month, will have its effect in Q1 of 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The fundamentals of the S&P 500...\n\n2021's actual EPS earnings for the S&P 500 was $208.49 per share. At today's S&P 500 premarket value of 3,786 that puts the current year PE at 18.15x. (The five year average of the S&P is: 18.6 the 10 year average of the S&P is: 16.9, which implies that there is further downside, especially considering that most notable analysts believe that earnings are NOT going to meet expectations. Further, S&P 500 EPS guidance for 2022 is about $225 per share and 2023's guidance is about $240 per share. That means that putting the 10 year average PE (16.9) to those estimated EPS numbers would have you arrive at $3,805.50 in 2022 and $4,056 in 2023. The big assumption is that the earnings hold up, which again, are being touted by the main stream media as overexuberant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere am I going with all of this? The bottom line is that I think earnings at the end of this month are going to be extremely important. We know that energy companies are going to kill it on earnings, however, they do not really make up that large of a weight in the S&P 500 (tech, of course, is really the most heavily weighted sector of the S&P and, coincidentally, could be the earnings that disappoint the most). So, I think it is reasonable to assume that earnings for the S&P in 2022, potentially, could be flat to 2021, which would put the number at $208 per share @ 16.9x would mean fair value of the S&P for 2022 may be 3,515.20 BUT if the big 5 report gangbuster earnings, and guidance, (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook) then I think the sentiment in the market may change and the EPS guidance that was estimated for 2022 could be achievable (2022 EPS guidance is 225 per share @ 16.9x would mean fair value is: 3,802 OR @ 18.6 fair value would be: 4,185.00\n\nI have a lot of cash on hand, right now, and a very sizeable position in the S&P 500 so I continue to nibble on decent dips, however, to me, fair value of the market is about 3,500 for the S&P. I think if we get to that number then I will be a big time buyer for the next 5-10 years. Until then, I will simply nibble and, if we get solid earnings and a nice rally, then so be it. But right now, cash is king but you absolutely should be putting some of it to work. If we get the big dip, go all in, if we don't, sit tight and see how the economy plays out over the next 6 months. Time in the market is, no doubt, the best strategy, however, patience in implementing capital is also a solid investing attribute. Be strategic in your purchases and, over the course of time, when the fed eventually reverses course and oil prices come down, you're going to be glad you nibbled into the market OR, again, if we get the big dip and you buy big, you're going to be happy you did as well, in 5-10 years time.", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty rational way of looking at it in terms of earnings. \n\nHowever, I think your point about the rate hikes not taking effect for 3-6 months is inaccurate.
