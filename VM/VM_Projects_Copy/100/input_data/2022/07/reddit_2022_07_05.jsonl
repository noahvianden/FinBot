He still should have known and after he thought about I bet he remembered. \n\n   But his point was still correct.  The government over spent and went a long way to creating this problem we have today.   especially the second huge stimulus. And  the red dress economist does little to help the history of the situation by playing the poor vs rich card.

It could have been far worse than it was.

Model Xs with doors and tailgates so badly aligned that they’ve slammed through the paint. Model S with panels so poorly fit together that you can stick your entire fingertip into it.

The FED has actually CUT money supply, which is obviously implied with QT, however, that makes me believe that the USD is something that is becoming more scarce (relatively speaking of course). Typically, I believe it take about 3-6 months for each hike the fed does to really take its effect on the actual economy, so you figure the most recent 75 basis point hike is going to have its effect in the late fall / early winter time. The 75 basis point hike they are about to do, I believe this month, will have its effect in Q1 of 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The fundamentals of the S&P 500...\n\n2021's actual EPS earnings for the S&P 500 was $208.49 per share. At today's S&P 500 premarket value of 3,786 that puts the current year PE at 18.15x. (The five year average of the S&P is: 18.6 the 10 year average of the S&P is: 16.9, which implies that there is further downside, especially considering that most notable analysts believe that earnings are NOT going to meet expectations. Further, S&P 500 EPS guidance for 2022 is about $225 per share and 2023's guidance is about $240 per share. That means that putting the 10 year average PE (16.9) to those estimated EPS numbers would have you arrive at $3,805.50 in 2022 and $4,056 in 2023. The big assumption is that the earnings hold up, which again, are being touted by the main stream media as overexuberant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere am I going with all of this? The bottom line is that I think earnings at the end of this month are going to be extremely important. We know that energy companies are going to kill it on earnings, however, they do not really make up that large of a weight in the S&P 500 (tech, of course, is really the most heavily weighted sector of the S&P and, coincidentally, could be the earnings that disappoint the most). So, I think it is reasonable to assume that earnings for the S&P in 2022, potentially, could be flat to 2021, which would put the number at $208 per share @ 16.9x would mean fair value of the S&P for 2022 may be 3,515.20 BUT if the big 5 report gangbuster earnings, and guidance, (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook) then I think the sentiment in the market may change and the EPS guidance that was estimated for 2022 could be achievable (2022 EPS guidance is 225 per share @ 16.9x would mean fair value is: 3,802 OR @ 18.6 fair value would be: 4,185.00\n\nI have a lot of cash on hand, right now, and a very sizeable position in the S&P 500 so I continue to nibble on decent dips, however, to me, fair value of the market is about 3,500 for the S&P. I think if we get to that number then I will be a big time buyer for the next 5-10 years. Until then, I will simply nibble and, if we get solid earnings and a nice rally, then so be it. But right now, cash is king but you absolutely should be putting some of it to work. If we get the big dip, go all in, if we don't, sit tight and see how the economy plays out over the next 6 months. Time in the market is, no doubt, the best strategy, however, patience in implementing capital is also a solid investing attribute. Be strategic in your purchases and, over the course of time, when the fed eventually reverses course and oil prices come down, you're going to be glad you nibbled into the market OR, again, if we get the big dip and you buy big, you're going to be happy you did as well, in 5-10 years time.", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty rational way of looking at it in terms of earnings. \n\nHowever, I think your point about the rate hikes not taking effect for 3-6 months is inaccurate.

Critique is useful, but deprave anger isn’t constructive.\n\nMy favorite people to talk to and make friends with have been honestly Chinese foreigners. They aren’t political because there isn’t really voting in the CCP. As a result, their culture derives from a family and relationship valued Confucian culture.

The difference is, that the dollar is supported by the government and BTC is not. For BTC to succeed in the manner the supporters think it will, the dollar has to collapse. No one wants that. The issue is then, that BTC is inherently deflationary which makes it I'll suited as a currency or trading device of any kind. Which makes it I'll suited regardless.
