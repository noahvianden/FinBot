I think this fiasco was a blessing in disguise. In my first two years of investing, everything was in the green. I felt I could do no wrong and I've found the cheat code to grow my money. I've learned my lesson the hard way but I'm still young and I'd rather lose some money now than 10 years later when I have more responsibilities.\n\nAnd for those asking, I have around $230k invested in the market (apart from a Vanguard 401k, but I don't ever look at that) and my losses accrue to $65k in total.

In the last 12 months, essentially 2021, SQ had revenue of 16.7 billion, gross profit of 4 billion, and a gain of 332 million in operating income.

There's a lot of talk about SQ's high PE ratio, which I acknowledge is high, but that is just one metric to consider. Remember, PE ratio is based on EPS, which is derived from a company's net income. Net income for a company can be deceptively low if a company is reinvesting its profits back into the business. (Think Amazon in the early 2000's). If it wanted to, SQ could spend millions less on R&D and realize profits, but that is not management's focus at the moment.\n\nThere's other things to consider, and I definitely have some reservations about aspects of its business (Tidal acquisition for example).

This is called an inverse gamma squeeze and it can put downward pressure on the stock. But if the share price goes up and there are lots of out of the money calls then those need additional hedging and the MMs will buy more. Similarly, if the MMs have sold puts, they hedge these by selling shares so that if the share price goes down and they are forced to buy shares off the person who bought the put, this can also cause downward pressure.

{"title": "Technical Analysis: Why the VIX is on its way to 150 and the SPX is on its way to <2000", "selftext": "Alright autists, this post is only for those of you who were around for the crash in Feb/March 2020. The rest of you can go bag hold more RBLX and GME shares.\n\nSo one of the big warning signs of a massive crash is a string of hindenburg omen, we had it right prior to the crash in Feb/March of 2020. Again, this is not the a definitive warning, as it has given many false positives such as in March 2021, and Nov 2020 Aug 2020, and May 2020. But there is more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ad5qq4x6sob81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=07098e28cc6c5944d7dde719b2d959e29001dd9e\n\nAnother thing to look at is breath of the market. We know that the breadth of the market is horrible, with something like 40% of NASDAQ down 50% for 2021. The entire stock market is held up by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook. The only times breadth was this terrible  was in 2000, Nov 2018, Feb 2020 and now in Jan 2022.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xs6q6t8ptob81.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=cefe6ce2eb7e5d86f3b03fb7c6771756706181bb\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is the VIX. In Feb 2020, you had a falling wedge in the VIX followed by a breakout before spiking to close to 80 in March.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uf9wu82ouob81.png?width=2439&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6569ba7c5cbeab5a8a138a75d329097cb67aaad\n\nA similar setup is happening today. Then there is the narrative, the market kept ignoring Covid which was baffling institutional investors going into Feb 2020, despite the rapid spread and the original variant having something like a 2-3% mortality rate. The same thing is happening today. The Fed signaled it was going to end QE and hike rates, but the market largely shrugged it off for a full month. Meanwhile China, the second largest economy where 1/3 of GDP is dependent on housing construction is rolling over and Russia is trying to invade Ukraine (which will send oil to $100+). Investors are ignoring all of this information.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqs98vnxuob81.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6b43b410c4a24e255a92c0f82fe2b538f241dfe\n\nAll of this is pointing towards a massive crash in the next couple of months. but you may counter, the fed won't let markets crash. If it tanks 10%, the fed will cave and give up on rate hikes and will start QE again and pump this market up like its 2020 again. The problem with this argument is that it makes a large assumption that the rise in stock market shares are driven by the fed, when there is a strong argument that it is in fact driven by the rise of passive investing (look into Mike Green if you want more analysis) on this and as a result is resembling a fractal that goes up in an exponential manner, with crazy deep flash crashes in between. This means it could suddenly crash 50% in 2 weeks and there would be nothing to stop it, because it is possible fed QE just creates bank reserves (which does nothing, read Jeff-Snider and Eurodollar University) and the only role the fed plays is in confidence in the market, and it can easily be destroyed like in March 2020, when the market crashed 15%, the fed then dropped rates to 0% and the market proceeded to crash more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmf51uavvob81.png?width=2011&format=png&auto=webp&s=21669f7c8c1cf42d7abe7b2a63d8f0998defd804\n\nTLDR: I got Feb/March VIX 30-60 calls.", "id": "s3y1s6", "created_utc": 1642182024.0, "score": 99, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 181, "comments": [{"body": "VariationSeparate I knew you didn't leave us", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "Why you gotta trigger my PTSD like that on a Friday.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "Do you?

Just look at China and how much credit they pumped through their system and their stock markets have been flat. The difference is that index fund penetration is low in China.
