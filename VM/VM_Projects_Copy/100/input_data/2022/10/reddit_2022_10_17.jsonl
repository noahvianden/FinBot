When it goes ITM isn't dictated by expiration, except that the further out expiration is, the more \"runway\" there is for the contract to go ITM.\n\nSecond, it doesn't have to go ITM for you to sell to close for a profit.

If you buy a stock and then it goes up 10%, do you worry about who in their right mind would buy it from you after it went up a whole 10%?!?! No. It's the same with options.\n\nIf you want to worry, worry when your contract has *lost* value. That's when it becomes hard to sell to close.\n\n> Are the ONLY profits being made here from premiums alone?\n\nIf you sell to close, yes. Just like trading stock.\n\nWhy is that so surprising? That's the *normal* case. Buy low, sell high. Or in the case of a seller, sell high, buy back low. That's basically what profitable trading means. What else is there? Exercise? That's the super exceptional rarely happens case.\n\n> What happens if my put option goes ITM the day-of or before the expiration date and I can't get my sell order for that option to fill?(earnings call play)\n\nCancel the order and offer a lower price. What else would you do? It's an auction. If no one is biting at your offer, you have to lower your offer. It's not a big deal.\n\nExample: Say to you bought a $100 strike put for $1 and now it is expiration and the stock price is $90. Your put ought to be worth at least $10.00, right? So you try to sell to close for $10.05 but nobody wants it. That's fine, no need to panic. You cancel you order and offer $10.00. Let's say you still can't get a fill. No problem, cancel and now offer $9.95 (let's say this is a nickel increment contract, which most stock options are). Instant fill, because you just gave away $5.00 of free money! But so what? You still get $995 in profit.\n\nIt's not like you are going to lose the entire $1000 gain on trying to get a fill. *At most*, you might give up one increment, which is typically $1 or $5.

It’s embarrassing and ultimately due to lack of discipline. Fortunately, I’ve never put in money that wasn’t expendable. Interestingly, for the past month I’ve stumbled upon a winning strategy and stuck with it and have had a win ratio of about 70% and am up 60% over the past month. It’s based on the principle that I’m not a wizard at picking intraday “winners” and also sell winners too quickly and hold onto losers for too long. It’s basically a strangle with 2-4 weeks te just otm options. The strangle allows me to feel more comfortable holding things overnight, etc. \n\n1) Find a stock with a lot of speculation, I do this by reviewing popularity lists in several apps, looking if there’s any new SPACs, and reading Reddit threads such as wsb and “short squeeze”. I also check when earnings are going to be and how the stock has responded to earnings in the past. Even better if this stock has been flat / consolidating for a while or is at an inflection point \n\n2) make sure the stock has favorable options (no wide bid/ask spread), favorable Greeks, etc. a call and a put of roughly the same cost so I can make sure my cost basis is the same. \n\n3) select one leg (call or a put) and try to scalp it for about 10%, if that works then I’m done with the stock and repeat the process starting with finding a new stock. if that’s not working then I lock it in with the other leg before it gets away from me. Or if it really does a headfake then I double the other leg and then lock that one in with some more of  the initial leg before eod. I tend to do a strangle of just otm options for a total position of about 10% of my portfolio (ie if I have $20k in my account then $1k in calls and $1k in puts). \n\n4) I sell these as soon as they’re profitable >20% or if I’m worried about it then I’ll sell before the theta decay gets too bad (ie making the trade a loser). I tend to sell both legs around the same time unless there’s a clear trend / runaway market. For the winners, I obviously use the winnings from the winning leg to more than offset the losing leg. \n\nSo my question is, does anyone have a good way to supplement my screening process (ie find stock options that are likely to be favorable to strangle) ?  Does anyone have a similar strategy? Would love to hear any and all advice . Maybe I should just stop since the market has been more volatile than usual and i could just be getting lucky because of that. \n\n\nRecent strangle winners:\n\nTlry, dwac, rblx, mmat, ATER, aprn and I just bought some 10dte fubo calls and puts right before market close today that I’m hoping will be a winner tomorrow\n\nThank you in advance …", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That is generally a topic for a Stock subreddit.   \n\nAfter you have a suitable stock, then you can  contemplate an options position.  \n\nThe links at the top of describe the necessity for having a trading plan, and working with high volume, low bid-ask-spread options", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Tried posting this in the main group, but the post was removed because my account is new and less karma.

Been trading equities (based on technical analysis) on and off for almost 10 years. Also been learning how to code and writing my own algo framework (its open source). I also have a safe long term portfolio with mostly dividend stocks (but most of them are in red, due to market downturn now). \r  \n\r  \nAs it stands, trading equities means being right on the direction and costs a huge amount upfront. My interest in options peaked during the last year and been paper trading (sometimes live) single calls/puts (OTM/ITM). But the problem there is still the direction need to be right, and within the time period! So upon researching, I came across verticals. Started to trade that too and won some and lost some. Most of these were 1-2 weeks expiration. Currently I switched it up a bit and paper trading 45 to 60 days expiration. I have 4 positions open currently (all paper - Debit spreads). I been reading a lot on tastytrades, optionsalpha etc about doing credit spreads too (in a high IV like this). Went through some posts here in this group and I see there is lots of good advice, just few hours of browsing made me think differently about certain topics.\r  \n\r  \nCurrently I have 4 positions as follows (I opened these like 2-3 weeks ago and at that time they were OTM):\r  \nORCL 65/67.5 Bull Call Spread Nov 18th (Debit) -> Cost 0.917 -> Current 1.46\r  \nAMZN 112/110 Bear Put Spread Nov 18th (Debit) -> Cost 0.926 -> Current 0.85\r  \nSQ 52.5/50 Bear Put Spread Nov 18th (Debit) -> Cost 1.214 -> Current 0.94\r  \nCOST 465/460 Bear Put Spread Nov 18th (Debit) -> Cost 2.617 -> Current 2.32\r  \n\r  \nCurrently ORCL is 60% profit, so from the threads that I read I am good to take profit at any level above 50%. Even though I have 1 month time left? The rest of the 3 are still negative. Another point to note is that I use Interactive Brokers and its showing me that for my overall positions, theta is (-0.3), vega is +1.1, gamma is (-1) and delta is +1 .. Can anyone throw some light on what I should be doing (if anything) or what the optiomal levels for these should be. \r  \n\r  \nTo stay focused, I also chose a bunch of stocks from different industries and want to play options only on those.

Welcome to the world of options trading.\n\nYou might have noticed that options trading is a little more than just leveraged equity exposure. Because options are convex, you can have unlimited profits and limited downside if you buy them (limited profits and unlimited downside if you sell them). This naturally introduces a volatility component to options trading - for example, as an option buyer, you want as much volatility as possible since you can make a bunch but can't lose more than your premium.\n\nTheta, Gamma, Delta, etc. are known as greeks. Stocks only have delta exposure; you make money when the stock price increases. With options, you have to consider the time value of the option, how much delta changes, and how volatile you think the stock will be.\n\nIt's complicated, but I highly recommend reading up on the greeks - books such as Euan Sinclair's *Options Trading,* John Hull's textbook *Options, Futures and Other Derivatives*, or Sheldon Natenburg's textbook *Option Volatility & Pricing* are good places to start. Probably start with Euan's book - just don't be intimidated by the math. Nobody really understands it the first time they read it.\n\nThere are no \"right\" levels of greeks, just as there would be no \"right\" level of exposure for an equity trader. It depends on what you think the market will do in the future. If you're still bullish/bearish, keep those positions on! If you're less confident, take the win/loss and move on to the next one.\n\nOne more thing - rules of thumb are pretty overrated. Stuff like closing at 50% or having a 3x stop loss aren't helpful. Closing early locks in profits, but you lose the chance to win big. Stop losses prevents big losses, but you lose the chance for your investment to turn around. Enter or exit trades depending on what you think the market will do, not because you lost money. Michael Burry didn't sell his Credit Default Swaps because his positions were losing money. Neither should you.\n\nI hope you don't feel clubbed over the head with too much information. Options trading is beautiful, and you have years to learn all the ins and outs of it.

I have a question and I hope I can get your help.\n\nI recently started learning about options. I understand the basics: what’s a call/option strike, expiration and stuff. I understand the long/short side of an option. By long I mean the buyer of a, lets say, a call option. And by short side I mean the seller. \n\nSo the long side in the call option contract buys the option. Then he has the right to exercise it. And the short side(the seller) is obligated to sell the asset to him for the predetermined strike price.\n\nIn the course that I am taking there was given the following example. Keep in mind the values are only for the purpose of illustrating a hypothetical situation. \n\nSPY is currently at 360. We buy a call option with a strike of 410. Expiration is in thirty days from now. The price of such option will be around 3 dollars. (That means 3 dollars per share right? So I will have to pay 3*100=300, because there are 100 shares in a contract). We buy the option for three dollars. In the example in the course after 10 days the price of SPY went to 390. Then the Indian guy told us that we do not have to wait for the expiration, to make a profit. He told us that the price of the option, although the price of SPY has not gone beyond the strike, will have gone up massively. Is that true? In every case? What of time decay? And he then told us that we can “sell” the option at a higher price. So we sell the call option. And make a profit. Does that mean we are now on the short side. Say in a few days the price of SPY goes to 420 and the guy who bought the option wants to exercise it. Am I now obligated to sell him 100 shares of SPY. Am I now the short side of the contract or am I out of the contract. Does this mean the original seller of the option (who sold it to me) is still in the contract and he still holds the obligation to sell 100 of SPY. \n\nI will be very grateful if I get a reply. Thank you in advance guys!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> So the long side in the call option contract buys the option. Then he has the right to exercise it. And the short side(the seller) is obligated to sell the asset to him for the predetermined strike price.\n\nWhile that is all technically accurate, try to get out of the habit of using unqualified \"buy\" and \"sell\", and unqualified \"buyer\" and \"seller\". I find that the most confusion comes from using those words without qualifying **who is opening** and **who is closing**.\n\nThis is because there are two kinds of buyers and two kinds of sellers, so if you just say \"buyer\" or \"seller\" it can be ambiguous. \n\n* Buy to open = BTO, the buyer is opening the trade\n\n* Sell to open = STO, the seller is opening the trade\n\n* Buy to close = BTC, the buyer is closing the trade\n\n* Sell to close = STC, the seller is closing the trade\n\n\n>  Then the Indian guy told us that we do not have to wait for the expiration, to make a profit. He told us that the price of the option, although the price of SPY has not gone beyond the strike, will have gone up massively. Is that true?\n\nI'm not sure why it matters that the guy was Indian, but ...\n\nOf course. If you BTO a call for $3.00 (and yes, contract prices are quoted per share) and a few days later it is worth $3.30, you can STC for a 10% profit. Who cares that SPY didn't go over the strike? Clearly, if the call was worth $3.00 when SPY was 360, it ought to be worth *more* if now SPY is 390 and there is still time before expiration. Did you expect the call to lose value when SPY went up? Stay the same? Why?\n\nThe strike price only matters at expiration. Before expiration, the value of a contract is determined by market supply/demand, just like shares of stock. If the call contract is super popular, because SPY seems to be heading in the right direction, of course the price is going to be bid up. What other possible direction could it go?\n\nWhen it comes to trading, contracts are not about expiration and exercise. They are about market value today vs. market value tomorrow (future). Just like trading shares of stock.\n\n>  In every case?\n\nNo. There is a situation that can happen where the market bid up the price so high that even if SPY goes up, the value of the contract has to go down.\n\nLet's say instead of $3.00, that 410 contract cost $69.00, an absurdly high price for the scenario. Even if SPY goes from 360 to 390, that $30 increase isn't enough to cover the $69.00 premium that people paid in the past, so the call's value may *decline* to get closer to the $30 increase in underlying value. This is called **IV crush**. The initial contract price of $69.00 was inflated beyond all reason, so the price crashed down to reality, even if the underlying goes up.\n\nStill has nothing to do with the strike price or expiration. It's all market supply/demand.\n\nMore about IV crush here: [Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value)\n\n> What of time decay?\n\nThat's priced in. For the original example where the call rose from $3.00 to $3.30, *without time decay* it might have risen to $3.35 instead. So the net of $3.30 is actually +$.35 - $.05 for time decay, resulting in +$.30 gain.\n\n> And he then told us that we can “sell” the option at a higher price. So we sell the call option. And make a profit. Does that mean we are now on the short side.\n\nPerfect example of why unqualified \"sell\" is ambiguous.\n\nIf instead your instructor has said \"sell to close\", there would be no confusion, right?

From a purely technical point of view the 3100 range is possible. This is based on a measured move taken from the last swing high down to the previous support line and then projected downward. It's an old school Dow theory method that's surprisingly accurate. \n\n\nOn a valuation basis it's going to be all about earnings. Right now est. earnings for the S&P is $209.29 a share for the year. The current forward PE is 17.39. That would give the index a value of around 3640. (Which is higher than where it closed on Friday) This is assuming that earnings hold up to expectations and/or there's no more multiple compression.\n\n\nSome analysts are predicting earnings to come in around 10% under estimates. If that's the case then 3200/3300 is in the cards (if the PE remains constant) and that is more in line with the technical target of 3100. If earnings are off that much I would imagine that the PE would also come in and markets would fall closer to the 3100 target.\n\n\nLet's say earnings do hold up but guidance is weak. That scenario could drive more selling, which would further compress the PE. Unless investors start to believe that the multiple is now attractive (by some metrics it is) and earnings don't spook market participants, then the market could rally - or at least stabilize and base.\n\n\nIMO the current route is all about three things: 1) Inflation. 2) Dollar strength. 3) Rising rates. If you're familiar with inter-market analysis then you'll know that these issues are all interconnected. If one of these breaks down (bullish for stocks) then most likely all three are breaking to the downside - or, they just stop going up.\n\n\nIn any event, as a 25 year old you should be buying as much of the index as humanly possible right here right now. And just keep buying. 35 year old you will be incredibly better off for it.\n\n\nMarkets are unpredictable. We can only use past data points to project future results.

(Started purchasing the SPY at a price of about $135 and some change. (It should be noted that I buy the S&P 500 at the end of each month, regardless of price, therefore, I have shares with a price of $135-$470 plus and I always reinvest the dividend). --- I am not clairvoyant (as I clarify further below) nor am I a \"market\" expert, however, time has shown that buying over the course of time yields beautiful returns, therefore, here is my view:\n\nI'm a fundamental investor so the way that I look at it is from a possible pricing perspective is this:\n\nEPS for 2022 are in a range of $210-$230. If you put a multiple of 15x to both of those numbers you end up with fair value of: 3,150 (15x multiple TIMES $210) and 3,450 (15x multiple TIMES 230).\n\nEPS for 2023 are in the range of $197-$232. If you use the same 15x multiple on the low range and high range estimates, you end up with the following values: 2,955 & 3,480 on the S&P.\n\nIt should be noted, just like the market overshoots to the high side (as far as PE goes), the market is also more than capable of overshooting to the downside.\n\nGenerally speaking, however, this is a great opportunity, for the long term investor, to get in the game if you are out of the market (which time has shown being out of the market is a BIGGER risk than the market actually dropping).\n\nCould the market go to $2500 with a 10-12 PE on forward earnings? Absolutely, however, the market could also reverse course and go to $4,500 with a 20 PLUS PE. (I'm not clairvoyant, never have been, so I have no clue). I just know that if the S&P 500 goes to ZERO then that means the likes of Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Visa, Exxon, Tesla, United Health, Procter and Gamble, etc....all go to zero. That means that money won't matter. Capitalism will be dead, gold will be worthless and we will literally be bartering for food. I just don't see this happening, therefore, the speculation of short term projections in the stock market make no sense to me so I just keep buying.\n\nHope this helps, as far as my approach to pricing on the S&P works, but I've been through the 2008 Financial Crisis where, literally, the system was on the brink of collapse and it survived that. If it could make it through that then, as long as the goal is to keep the capitalistic society we have in tact, the market will, over time, respond accordingly, in a positive manner.\n\nGood luck to all and feel free to message me with any further questions if you have any.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "> Could the market go to $2500 with a 10-12 PE on forward earnings?
