Those are biggest reason for my gains  Those puts expire next week and I'll be not reselling them until we hopefully see little selloff post DISCK merger and I'll resell them again. Added little BABA and TCEHY start of year which is now pretty much at my cost basis. Holding homebuilders PHM and MHO from last winter which I knew is a long term payoff (2yr +), which are my biggest losers YTD down around 10-20%. Added small amount of GOOGL, FB, TROW and AMZN in Feb. Those are all up. Sold FL puts after it's drop and wishing I sold more. \n\nOn the occasion I compare it to SnP I've been beating it by 8-20% consistently in 2022. I underperformed SP in 2021 and 2020 by 1-2% each year. I'd have to pull up my old excels to give you years prior to that, but I beat it slightly each year 2016-2019. I didn't track my portfolio properly before 2016, wish I knew better back then. All of this is noise and unimportant anyway. Better questions are how is someone's performance over 5 years or more and how much risk are you assuming compared to the S&P? Imo the S&P was and still is too overweight the top companies. I'm not a huge over diversification guy, but last few years the index is getting way too overweight for my taste, so I've been totally fine with underperforming a tad if I sleep better at night with the valuation of the stocks I hold and having better dispersed allocation amongst them.

WMT is a great example. I sold a put and got assigned, have owned WMT for over a year and sold a call almost every month which expired worthless for profit.\n\nThe thing about the put selling strategy is that you require some capital to cover the assignments, but it lets you run almost completely cash month to month as most of the puts expire worthless and you pocket the premiums.\n\nAnyways, I'm up about 3% this year due to bearish conditions.

The FSD wanted to navigate into the right most lane for travel.  The problem is this is a well traveled road with fairly heavy morning traffic.  Changing lanes and then having to change back again in less than a quarter mile will just piss off all the other drivers off as everyone knows that right lane is going to branch off and the left lane is for through traffic.  \n\nSo the FSD turned on the right blinker to move to the right lane and started to move, I hit the signal stalk to indicate not to make the lane change.  The FSD stopped making the lane change, paused for about a second and then signaled once again and tried to make the lane change.  I counter signaled again.  Politely saying to the car \"no, not a smart maneuver to make right now\"; how many others out there talk to the car about its driving decisions?  Rinse repeat for a couple more times.  Then I think I hit the stalk a little two hard and bumped the system out of FSD as we were getting close to the roundabout.  \n\nAnnoying that my countermand to the FSD only lasted a second or so each time and it continually wanted to change lanes. \n\nSo that's my first world problem this morning.

(JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon's total compensation rose to $84.4 million for 2021, up from $31.7 million in 2020, according to the bank's annual proxy statement filed Monday. The figure includes $52.6 million in option awards for 2021, up from no option awards in 2020. \"The special award granted to Mr. Dimon reflects the board's desire for him to continue to lead the firm for a further significant number of years,\" the company said. \"The board also took into account other factors, including the firm's strong performance under Mr. Dimon's stewardship since 2005, his exemplary leadership, and his significant contributions to the firm's success during his tenure.\" Dimon's total annual compensation in 2021 rose to $34.5 million from $31.5 million in 2020 and 2019. The increase was due to a $3 million boost he received in performance share units (PSUs) to $28 million in 2021 from $25 million. His salary remained at $1.5 million. Shares of JP Morgan Chase are down 14.6% so far in 2022, compared to a drop of 4.6% by the S&P 500 and a loss of 4.2% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\n\\-Steve Gelsi\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n04-04-22 0730ET\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\n**Footnote**: JPMorgan reached an all-time high of **$172.96** on October 25, 2020.

{"title": "The Fed has more money on its balance sheet (8.9 trillion) then the total value of all 401ks in the United States (7.3 trillion as of 9/21).", "selftext": "\n5 trillion of that was added to the Fed’s balance sheet since Feb. 2020: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL\n\n401k balances: https://www.ici.org/401k\n\n——\n\nBut oh ya, inflation is only happening because the ships and ports and all that jazz. Definitely not also because of the largest instance of debt monetization in the history of mankind.\n\nThis behavior jeopardizes the USD’s status as the reserve currency of the world.\n\n\nEdit: Not saying that expanding the money supply is the only factor driving inflation. Supply chain issues, as we’ve been experiencing, increases inflation. Supply chain issues + expanding the money supply makes inflation even worse; it exacerbates inflation. I’m also not saying it was a bad thing for the Fed to respond as quickly and vigorously as they did. I do, however, think it was a mistake to add 2 trillion more to their balance sheet from August 2020 until now, amid increasing demand pressures and supply shortages. They kept adding to their balance sheet, expanding the money supply, even as the US made it through the eye of its economic storm.\n\nI also chose 401ks as a reference point to compare against. 9 trillion is hard to conceive of. Thought that a unit of comparison would help. Other comparisons. US GDP = approx. 25 trillion. California GDP = approx. 3.5 trillion. Texas GDP = approx. 2 trillion. NY GDP = approx. 2 trillion. Florida GDP = approx. 1.2 trillion. GDP of UK = 3 trillion. GDP of Germany = 4 trillion. GDP of Mexico = 1 trillion. GDP of Canada = 1.6 trillion.
