That's just because I don't know the exact day & time the shares were bought (and even if I did, I don't have the ) Good enough for my \"profit margin percentage\" calculation to get a rocket-ship number, may or may not be good enough for the IRS.\n\nObligatory not-a-tax-professional disclaimer.\n\nIn the absence of brokerage data, the IRS would default it to being entirely profit, in other words a cost basis of $0. So if I made $100K and didn't have a cost basis, they'd tax me 15% of ($100K - $0) = $15k. This is the maximum amount I can be taxed on this trade (if you found a briefcase full of money on the street, the IRS still expects their cut). Which sounds like it sucks, but you have to remember the amount they were probably bought for - say they paid $1K for those shares, which would mean the correct amount of tax I'd pay would be 15% of ($100K - $1K) = $14,850 saving a whole $150. ~~It's my understanding you can use an estimate like this as a cost basis on your shares for tax purposes and report it as such, but since your number now doesn't match up with the IRS and your state taxes is that $150 worth the hassle of maybe getting an audit? Up to you (and me come tax time).~~ See edit 2\n\nWhere it really sucks is if it goes the opposite way and you sell for a loss and the cost basis is missing. They still assume that sale was entirely profit, but you actually lost money which would reduce your tax liability. Same example but other way. Say you get gifted $100K in stocks long ago, and end up selling them for $10,000 but the c/b is missing. You'll get taxed 15% of ($10K - $0) = $1,500, but you should be getting taxed 15% of ($10K - $100) = -$13.5k. They owe you money!!! (well not owe, it would offset taxes you paid on positive trades but it's not refundable so they won't cut you a check for it). In that case, I'd argue it's definitely worth fighting for.\n\nEdit: on the point of the data being missing, I don't think it's too uncommon. Someone else said brokerages used to not have to be responsible for retaining the cost basis info since they didn't have to report it to the IRS. You and I had to keep track of that ourselves (probably on *paper, yuck*). Even if they did have it, they didn't used to be required to transfer that information when you move the stocks to a new brokerage or say they got acquired and your brokerage account transitions from one to the other.\n\nEdit 2: Doing a little more research, seems like it's something that can be fixed if you work with your brokerage - you give them what information/documentation you have for what to use as the cost basis and they can correct it on their end (maybe an estimation is sufficient for them, maybe it's not, probably depends on the brokerage). So then when you sell, they report the rectified cost basis to the IRS.

To be fair it Now to be fair there were a lot of other good financial choices from my parents, my wife, and myself along the way. Things like how my parents saved for my college education & used a 529 program, going to a state school for a higher paying field, my then girlfriend / current wife living at home after graduation for several years and pounding every dollar she made into the market (especially during the start of covid), and generally living below our means. My wife didn't have this same stock-from-birth that I did, but she's putting down just as much money as me, if not more. My trade was a piece of a financial puzzle (a pretty decent sized one, but still just a piece).\n\nI just don't want to misrepresent and make it sound like I'd be destitute without it, so as not to discourage anyone reading into thinking that you have one shot to do the perfect trade or else your kids lives will be ruined.

The disadvantage compared to a 529 is that it doesn't have special tax advantages like a 529 does. There's a little bit of tax benefit since if you hold funds/stocks that generate dividends they probably won't generate enough income for your kid to have to file taxes on it, but realize more than a couple thousand dollars in gains and the excess gets taxed at your tax bracket (the key phrase to look into is [\"unearned income\" or \"kiddie tax\"](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc553)). It's kind of best for long term buy-and-hold IMO.  \n\nSo it sort of depends on what exactly you're earmarking the money for. If you want it specifically for education, 529 is the way to go. If you want more flexibility in the investments and what the money can inevitably be used for, then UGMA/UTMA is the way to go.
