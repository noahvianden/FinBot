If the ask $10 and the bid is $1, someone (usually, this will be a \"market maker\") will start to close that gap. If someone comes along with a limit order for $10, it will get filled at a lower price. In reality, on an exchange with reasonable volume the ask would never be 10x the bid, because the exchange would have already halted trading. (There are \"OTC\" trades that might occasionally have such a spread, avoid that)\n\nAdditionally, even if this situation somehow happened, the next share is going to be sold somewhere in the \"real\" bid/ask spread (closer to $1 in your hypothetical, and the market cap would only blip.\n\n> \"now worth ten times more and it would be over valued\"\n\nThis goes both ways. If someone were to walk in and try to buy NVDA at a valuation of $3.4 Trillion today, they'd not be able to. By buying up 50% + 1 shares or even a smaller amount, the price would rise, so the original market cap would \"under value\" the company.

{"title": "I sold my Tesla shares and here’s why", "selftext": "Tesla’s stock price depends on it “not being a car company”. Usually people have pointed to it being an “energy” company or an “AI” company where the market potential in either sector is huge. The problem is I don’t have any evidence of anyone else at the company aside from Elon driving this vision. Ever since Tesla almost went bankrupt my impression is the company is largely built around reacting to Elon’s direction, which was fine when Elon was largely focusing on Tesla. However it seems quite clear that Elon, who is a very “mission” driven individual, has other missions such as “protect free speech”, “destroy the work mind virus”, and “extend humanity beyond Earth” that are much more important and interesting to him than dominate the energy sector. AI is also interesting to him, though it’s not quite clear to what end, and in theory that should bode well for Tesla as he previously touted Tesla as having amazing AI capabilities because of FSD. However more and more it seems that he’s putting his AI initiatives beyond FSD in xAI. To the extent that I was surprised when he was previously polling on X whether Tesla should invest I think it was 5B in xAI at what I imagine would be an unreasonable valuation at probably a minority ownership. Why is he doing this? Why didn’t he put xAI under Tesla from the beginning? The reason is control. At this point in Elon’s life he doesn’t want to spend much time on something he can’t fully control, and with Tesla as a listed company it will always be both 1) at risk of loss of control  and 2) just in general annoying to administer - even if he has control there will always be more hoops to jump through, which he hates, compared to a private company.\n\nSo what is Tesla now to Elon? It’s his cash cow to fund his other initiatives. And without him focusing on Tesla, and without other competent leadership at the company to drive these ambitious initiatives, all of these ambitious projects that are still a long way from completion, will be more akin to ambitious projects at Google. Robotaxis looks more like Google Glass than Starlink.\n\nSo that’s it, I think Tesla will chug along and Elon will involve in Tesla mainly to the extent of reacting to keeping the stock price reasonable. Currently the price is inflated based on people going “he did XYZ at other companies so don’t underestimate him on Tesla”. But for the reasons I mentioned above despite Elon’s successes elsewhere it’s not going to happen at Tesla.\n\nWould love to hear what others think.", "id": "1g3b8zi", "created_utc": 1728895418.0, "score": 258, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 400, "comments": [{"body": "I’m a diehard Tesla fan and investor and agree with a lot of your points.

It can dynamically adjust steering ratios based on driving conditions, offering better handling at high speeds and easier maneuvering at low speeds.\n- Enhanced Autopilot Capabilities: Tesla’s self-driving features could benefit greatly from SBW. By removing mechanical components, Tesla could fine-tune the steering response for autonomous driving, ensuring smoother and more accurate lane changes, turning, and parking.\n- Weight and Space Reduction: SBW eliminates the need for mechanical components like the steering column, which reduces the vehicle’s weight and frees up interior space. This could further enhance Tesla’s electric range and improve efficiency.\n-Increased Flexibility in Cabin Design: Without the need for a traditional steering column, Tesla could explore innovative interior designs, including retractable or repositionable steering wheels. This could also pave the way for future fully autonomous vehicles where the driver may not always need manual control.\n- Safety Enhancements: SBW can introduce additional layers of safety by allowing electronic overrides in case of emergencies, such as rapid lane correction or obstacle avoidance.

That makes perfect sense to me.  Elon’s super power is selecting the best /brightest and ensuring they are kept focused on the real problems and motivated.  Another superpower he has is going after high value problems.  Most companies that have wild success start playing it safe as ‘conservative’ types gain control. Apple/GE/Intel/RIM there are tons of examples.  Happened at Apple twice.  The truth is you have to make big bets to grow 5 or 10x.

We should separate what (FUD) articles, Reddit rants, and what data and charts say.  \n  \nOn Robotaxi—it's likely a 3-5 year investment horizon. If that's too long for you, that's understandable.

I still believe Tesla can succeed but I’m not sure they can do it with the man in charge. I realize people here love them some Elon, except those who just want to make some money on their investments, so come at me bro I really don’t care. I’m a TSLA investor who bought in before I realized this guy would buy a social media platform on accident in one of the worst deals… no the worst deal this guy has ever done. He’s going to have to cash out shares or otherwise divert TSLA money to Twitter.

He can be a Republican, who cares, but this very public disaster that is playing out and costing US car sales issues. I guarantee Q4 deliveries are going to be the worst ever in the US. I’m not basing this on theory just leftists and centrists that are done with Elon and don’t want to be done with Tesla are still making the choice to switch brands. I’m in a very red state so listening to the right say they won’t buy electric cars from anyone, ever (70% official number), tells me that we have a serious problem as my friends who are largely centrists are switching or refusing to upgrade while other companies work on infrastructure. It’s not FSD they want, I have 9 friends who own a Tesla and two of us use FSD, the rest can afford it and outright think it’s terrible which I find odd but they do live in major metro cities that haven’t been fully mapped like Robotaxi has access to. \n\nTesla is setup for major success and will soon be setup to be the only car company that is basically farm to table US and that’s absolutely the best thing ever which is a big reason I’ll likely upgrade my highland when there is finally another good option for a small performance car. If the M3P can’t take Hyundai around a track then maybe once they lease FSD as they have to do (wait for Q4 and Q1) or wait until China kicks Tesla out or suspends operations due to 100% tariffs on their cars which the CCP will 1,000% retaliate against, it’s going to cause an extreme need to realize income from software only. Maybe that’s actually the solution, to take charging (already happening) and let anyone in removing the largest advantage Tesla has and will have for the foreseeable future. I need to see the profit coming from allowing other EVs to use their chargers. \n\nTesla can succeed if they can hire the best engineers but the smartest people I know in information technology of any specialty refuse to work for any Elon company. They don’t believe in working 18 hours a day for an extra 20%. They don’t want to work at places that they could be in a massive layoff at anytime. This is also why other large companies are losing top tier engineers. Tesla should be done with FSD but the one thing Elon never talks about slowing progress are due to people quitting from key positions because Elon likes to think that there are no key positions or people who can’t be replaced. Yes everyone including Elon is replaceable but by someone as good? That’s the question we never ask when someone says that bs. Tesla is literally on autopilot and doesn’t need more false promises.

It has been a tough 2 years for all auto except the cheap car brands. Some will argue legacy auto been doing good, but only because they been selling to dealerships with empty lots until recently. Interest rates come down and when recession is past, people start buying cars again. Tesla compact car starts production in first half of 2025, this should be reaffirmed on Q3 earnings call. Tesla does not talk about it because of the osborn effect.  China sales are going up, EU is down as they as parts of EU are in recession, and US is waiting for their recession.\n2. Energy. This is the fasted part of the business growing. In 2023 generated $6 billion revenue and in 2024 will come in around $10 billion revenue with around 25% gross margin. China megapack factory starts production in Q1 2025 which doubles or more the current capacity of megapacks. Energy for 2025 I think will land around $15 billion with 27% margin.\n3. Services. Growth will be 20-25% I think YoY. More EVs on the road means more using super chargers, more 4 year warranties expire means more are paying for repairs instead of Tesla. This will continue to grow.\n4. Robotaxi. Starting up in Texas and Cali next year, though will not have an impact on earnings for a while, it will move the stock up once it starts. Robocab starts production once robotaxi has expanded to enough states, but us 3/Y until then.\n5. Optimus. No sales to others until 2026 but Tesla is currently using at least a few in their factory and said to have a couple thousands by end of 2025, while does not generate revenue, it will lower costs to build EVs which improves margins.\n6. Tesla semi. While not a big affect for a while, each warehouse that uses them will also need a megapack, super chargers, and likely solar panels install.\n7. The AI SaaS business that is part of everything Tesla is making. AI in energy storage, in EVs, in Optimus and the AI services that Tesla may offer at some point.\n\nI focus on the business and don't let the non-Tesla stuff distract me from what the business is doing. The last 4 years are like 2015-2019, the stock goes nowhere but the company continues to develop the business. Tesla is disrupting many huge industries and analysts are having a hard time understanding what Tesla is doing.\n\nI have no concerns on what Tesla is doing.

One of the core interests of conservatives in America (not the average working type, but political strategists types) is to privatize everything, or at least make everything pay to play.  One of those spaces is the public road ways.  Generally they've gone after this with toll roads.  A good example of this is how carpool lanes in California have been shifted to \"FastTrack\" lanes.  The original purpose of taking a lane on the public highway was to encourage ride sharing to alleviate traffic during peak times.  In some places it's effectively been converted to a toll lane instead.\n\nWhat's going to happen in places like California and Texas when robotaxis for private purchase hit the streets is it's going to impact traffic.  The response is probably going to be increase the cost of use through vehicle registration, which wont be a problem for people who are constantly monetizing their cars (regardless of fleet size), but will impact people who just want to drive on the public road.\n\nIt's the exact same thing that has happened with housing.  Excess demand led to cost escalation resulting in higher and higher mortgage payments as people entered the housing market.  That increased pressure for people to look for passive income opportunities like a second house they could rent out (short or long term) or adding an accessory structure.  That initial excess demand pressure was driven in part because of investors and Wall Street buying up properties to turn into income generating sources.\n\nThe long term end result of what is going on with this is that the only people who are going to be able to use the public roads are the people who can afford to, and the only people who are going to be able to afford to are going be wealthy people, companies, and people who are offsetting the cost by monetizing their vehicle.

My added prediction is that cities will establish a perimeter around the core which can only be crossed by cars that can allow control by the city's centralized driving system.

I'm sure the police would love being able to remote control any car and DUI would never be possible.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe.  The struggle with that is that every vehicle has to be on the same communications protocol and be able to talk to eachother and the city.  That's not easy to accomplish across manufacturers, especially when software is treated as proprietary.  You also can't force it unless it's a government mandate.  Any city that does that is also running the risk of losing tourism for people that drive there but can't get in because their car doesn't comply.  I think as far as safety goes we're more likely to get to a point where we have tiered drivers licenses or stricter license requirements and it's a lot easier to lose your license.  Also police have been able to shut down certain cars remotely for a long time.\n\nIn urban planning circles \"car free\" zones are a pretty hot topic of conversation and the trend is to move communities to lower impact modes of transit.  You reclaim significant amounts of land that can be turned toward housing and green space when you eliminate the need for cars (or at least greatly reduce the need).  It's probably going to start with car free and emission free zones for high density cities.  I would expect car free zones to expand with scattered pay to park lots with L2 chargers where people leave their cars for the day, and they either walk, use a mobility device (ebik, scooter, whatever), and take the local public transit.\n\nNot everywhere is a big city though.  America is full of low density low traffic places where people live.  The US needs to get back to building out an infrastructure system that efficiently connects those areas.  Right now we use planes and cars.  And unless you've driven all around the county, you can't really appreciate the scale or environmental diversity.  There are also a lot of people who live in very urban environments that forget that there are many people in the US that live places that are so low density that there is not really a viable public transit system short of a publicly funded shuttle service that you scheduled the night before (and that might be a bit of a pipe dream).\n\nThe urban model is a pretty easy one to solve and planners I think are plugging away at that.  You run into problems, especially in a place like California or Texas, when you try to apply an urban solution through a state mandate (which happens... often).  It causes a lot of strife and discontent between people who live in low density places and people who live in high density places.  People have to focus on nested systems of transit and flexible rules that allow communities to develop localized programs that work for them.\n\nSilicon Valley especially I think has a really skewed view of what's needed to address transit problems because that area is a lot of sprawl with odd highway systems that go around the bay.  Public transit in San Francisco is pretty good.  Public transit in and out... less good the last time I took it.  Fares were also the same as fuel costs to just drive, so there was little incentive.  And public transit on the peninsula, east bay, and south bay... boy I sure hope it has gotten better... because yikes.  There's a reason tech companies set up their own private bus service to pick up employees.  And if you have to live in that traffic every day, I can see why you'd want a fully self driving car.  But they could also give up a highway lane and put in a better public transit system.  The area has more than enough wealth to make it happen.\n\nThe problem is that if you spend all your time in those areas and build your perspective on what the \"right\" transit solution is you end up missing the mark because that area has very specific problems (that also change over time).  Different highway routes developed different levels of traffic congestion over time as housing prices changed in the area and different companies set up shop and grew their workforce.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well, I, for one, would NEVER hope you get hit by a bus.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is the Waymo approach, with a little extra smarts (some generalization) for when more unpredictable things happen. Even with all that they STILL get stuck quite often.\n\nTesla is trying to create an AI that \"plays chess\" by calculating the next best move by looking ahead a few steps but the number of possible moves increases significantly with each step you take. There's no hardware in existence that can do such computations, and won't be for some time. Even actual chess AI that operates this way needs to run on some pretty hefty hardware, and that's just an 8x8 board. Imagine trying to do that with traffic, pedestrians, signage, roadworks, weather, potholes, drive throughs, parking, emergency vehicles, etc?\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they pivot to a more mapped out and structured approach like Waymo. The AI does really well on highways which, if using the chess analogy, it's probably similar to trying to solve a 2x2 grid. Significantly easier.\n\nThese new robotaxis will likely only operate in very specific areas.
