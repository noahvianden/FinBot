{"title": "Blew my account with options. But I never gave up. Still 100% options. ", "selftext": "I hope to share my \u201ccome back\u201d story to those who lost hope. It\u2019s still a work in progress but trading has been fun. It tests us to the limit and builds character. \n\nI entered the stock market in Jan 2021. The first stock I bought was CCIV (now lucid) with options and it was the tail end of the spac-mania. Put in about 20k and life was good. I didn\u2019t know making money was so easy. Waking up and find thousands of dollars in my account. In 1 month, I 4x the money. Surely I can do it again? \n\nFast forward, I lost it all. All 80k. No risk management, nothing. \n\nTook a 6 months break. But I came back, 100% on options. \n\nThis is not addiction. This is dedication. \n\nHonestly, I can\u2019t remember what I bought when I returned. I only remember buying Chinese options when HSI (hong Kong index) went back to 1997 level. Gained lots but lost more and I swore to never touch Chinese stock again. But they become relevant again because of the stimulus. (More on that later)\n\nMy low point was 7k at the start of 2024 and I managed to 5x it with the AI boom. I\u2019m fucking sure no one expected the market to recover late last year. AI carried the entire stock market. \n\nI\u2019m lucky I was out before the implosion happened on late July - August. I was still down 20% but remember, it\u2019s 100% options. It could be much worse. \n\nRight now I\u2019m 60% in US stocks (30% in Tesla for the robo taxi) and 40% in Chinese stocks. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve learnt so far:\n-slow money is faster. Fast money is death. \n-price to dream ratio is the best when things are hyped and uncertain. (Hence Tesla and Chinese stock)\n- don\u2019t earn the last dollar. Run when everyone is onboard. (Totally out of AI) \n-never concentrate more than 30% in 1 holding. \n-when you are not certain, Buy/Sell half of the intended position. \n- you only buy more/leverage more if you are in the green. Never the other way around. \n\n\nLooking ahead, I positioned more Chinese options. I think this is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for. I can read Chinese and I find that English DD doesn\u2019t go into the details of the stimulus. Particularly, 800b yuan swap facilities for collaterals (including stocks which makes even less supply) can ONLY be used to buy stocks. This is their equivalent of QE and their timing is impeccable. (They were waiting for fed to cut rates.) they probably also need the stock market to replace their currently dead real estate market. \n\n3 Reasons to buy\n1. Stocks can be used as collateral and be locked up (supply drops) and the money must go into the stock market. (Demand increase)\n2. It\u2019s mentioned that there could be more rounds of the same size. \n3. They are cheap. Many stocks\u2019s Forward PE is single digit. Vs high 20s in US. \n\n3 Reasons not to buy. \n1. It\u2019s Chinese. \n2. It\u2019s Chinese. \n3. It\u2019s Chinese. \n\n\nTLDR. Got greedy + cocky and lost it all. But I\u2019m glad I lost it all early rather than later. I made a comeback over the past 10 months. Betting on Chinese stocks now. Still 100% on options.

The difference though is the US and Japan were printing money to do so. By doing this China can pretty much do what the US and Japan did. Manipulate GDP numbers,put money into people\u2019s pockets which would then increase spending from profits made from stock market rally. When the Chinese make money, the first thing they do is go out and buy cars and houses. This would resolve quite a bit of the housing glitch market issues in China. This would also increase spending, which would change a lot of the numbers in China. It would also raise funds for manufacturers in China that are competing with the US and the chip industry. With all this money coming back from the US into China\u2019s market, it would make China\u2019s market more stable and by doing so many countries would view China\u2019s market and economy as being stable just like they did of that of the US in Japan, which then led to money coming in from other countries The same what happened in China. The Chinese are actually quite smart. They figured if Japan and the US could do it. We could do it as well. The Chinese stock, market and indexes pretty much rallied over 35% in under 10 days trading. What took US index nine months to gain they did and just under 10 days so imagine the buying power in China compared to that of the US. The same applies to Japan. I don\u2019t think any index or market around the world was able to gain 35% or more and under 10 days. That is what you call a bull market. In the US, the money from QE was the equivalent of $100 billion per month but recently overtime has dropped to around 80 billion per month. When you do the numbers that is roughly $4 billion per day that they have at their disposal to inject into the market at any time. It\u2019s pretty much pure manipulation and they were able to manipulate the market and index for the Dow to go from 20,000 to 40,000 just over double And the same applies for NASDAQ and the S&P 500. China never really did this. They use their money to prop up their infrastructure and their country. They did not use their money to prop up the stock markets. Now that they\u2019re infrastructure is way ahead of out of the US. They can start propping some of their money into the markets as well when Covid hit the US put out stimulus packages and gave the people money. China did not do so and many of their people were not happy many businesses shut down many people lost money. Many people are unemployed, and this is where the problems started for the Chinese and China. China has now realize this and wanted to put some money into the pockets of their people so the money that they sold from US treasury notes and bond, which came back to China pretty much got directly injected back into their markets and will continue to do so.

{"title": "The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ", "selftext": "Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. \n\nThe ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.\n\nAccording to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.\n\nBelow is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..\n\n|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|1933.5|10.91||\n|1940|12.05|10.44%|\n|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|\n|1953|26.38|43.13%|\n|1959.5|58.68|122%|\n|1966|92.88|58%|\n|1972.5|107.14|15%|\n|1979|99.93|-7.22%|\n|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|\n|1992|408.78|113%|\n|1998.5|1133.84|177%|\n|2005|1181.27|4.10%|\n|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|\n|2018|2471.65|87.10%|\n|2024.5|5525.29|123%|\n\nWhile the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.\n\nHistorically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.\n\nCurrently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.\n\nIn the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...\n\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).\n* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).\n* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).\n\nImages aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07\n\nHistorically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.\n\n* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.\n* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.\n* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).\n\n**Okay -- so**\u00a0***Maybe***\u00a0**we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**\n\nOutside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.\n\n* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.\n* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.\n* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.\n* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.\n* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.\n* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.\n* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.\n* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).\n* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.\n* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.\n* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.\n* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.\n* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.\n* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.\n* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.\n\nI believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.\n\n**This economic downturn may be severe.**\n\nIn the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.\n\n**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**\n\nPeople have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.\n\nThis will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.\n\n**What happens from here?**\n\nI don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.\n\nThe prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. \n\n**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**\n\nMy positions: \n\nBought 50 $570 10/2 puts at open this morning right at open.

Nowadays, SPY and other various S&P500 trackers literally hoover up people\u2019s personal savings, from across the globe. Even on countries like mine (England) where pensions are more powerful than the US, around 23% of the population invests in the stock market, most people set it and forget it on an automatic monthly investing schedule. The top two ETFs people go for here is VWRP and VUAG, the first one being an all world tracker with 2/3 of its weight in the S&P 500, and the second one just being a straight up S&P 500 tracker.\n\nAnd this is in the U.K - we don\u2019t invest in the FTSE 100, Japanese people aren\u2019t investing in the Nikkei, mainland Europeans aren\u2019t investing in the STOXX 50, etc. Everyone across the globe invests one way or another in the US stock market, specifically S&P 500. Most people aren\u2019t active trader types, they just have a monthly direct debit so it automatically buys into the S&P 500 for them every month.\n\nEven 10 years ago this wasn\u2019t really much of a thing. But with investing/broker apps being so mainstream and easy to access on phones, there\u2019s massive amounts of people investing in the US stock market. Much more so than there was in the era of the GFC or the dot com bubble. \n\nLike I said, nowadays it is literally the global hoover of everyone\u2019s personal savings.

People from across the globe don\u2019t chose the S&P 500 because they\u2019re a big fan of America, they chose it because there\u2019s nowhere else in the globe that offers such a good mix of massive growth stocks and matured global mega corps. For example, I will never invest in the UKs FTSE 100 because it\u2019s comprised of very matured and boring companies that see almost no growth, it\u2019s the same case with Europe. Banks and Insurance dominates. I\u2019ve spoken to people from Hong Kong and China who rather invest in the S&P over their countries indexes for similar reasons and also because you can be certain that business will always be stable in the US, you can\u2019t say that for China/India etc. \n\nBasically, america is just the most attractive place in the world to invest in because it sees the best growth whilst also being the most reliable and stable. You think a world ending -20% crash for the S&P 500 is bad, look at the S&P China 500. Roughly -28% in 2018, -52% crash from 2021-2022. India\u2019s Nifty 50 has performed really well and stable actually, but even so, they\u2019ll invest in the US. \n\nUntil America stops seeing monster growth mixed in with matured mega corps and pretty much unrivalled economic stability and security, people won\u2019t stop pouring their savings into it. And the strongest military in the world defends that economy\u2019s interests.\n\nAlso a side note, I don\u2019t see the US stock markets growth elements dying any time soon either, largely because the best and brightest workers and entrepreneurs in the world all go to America because A) the best and brightest workers get paid better and B) the entrepreneurs with ideas for \u201cthe next big thing\u201d go to America because it\u2019s the easiest place to get Venture Capital funding, it\u2019s the startup capital of the world. Conversely, this is an issue for the U.K. and Europe (I know of this first hand), and likely India and China aswell, because there\u2019s a thing called brain drain. It\u2019s a real issue in my country and all of Europe, and it\u2019s basically the concept I just explained. Our nations smartest people leave us to go to America because they can get double, triple the pay if not more. Hence the name \u201cbrain drain\u201d, the US hoovers up all the smart people in the world. \n\nSo I don\u2019t personally think that people will lose confidence in the US stock market any time soon simply for the fact that I don\u2019t see any other country becoming a more attractive place to invest in any time soon - Americas closest rival is china, and no one wants to touch Chinese stocks with a 10 foot barge pole (relatively speaking ofcourse).", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "You're not wrong -- I fully understand that the USA is the prettiest horse at the glue factory. \n\nBut if I'm of the belief that we will see a massive, global economic downturn -- which I am -- \n\nThen\n\n1.
