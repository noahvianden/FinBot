I'd be wise to diversify, but I've been saying this for 6 months. The only time I added to it was a short swing trade when it got back into the 90s. I was going to hold past earnings, but I sold just before at \\~128.5. Obviously...hindsight and all that, but I'd still advise buying NVDA.\n\nThe question should have been more about AVGO right NOW. Right now it feels more like NVDA post-split when it was around 140...but without the market dominance. \n\n\n\nAnyway, AVGO is too expensive at the moment.

{"title": "Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion", "selftext": "Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker\u2019s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.\n\nNvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.\n\nCompanies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.\n\nOf the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.\n\nNvidia\u2019s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.\n\nNvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is \u201cinsane\u201d and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-shares-hit-a-record-as-chipmaker-market-cap-tops-3point4-trillion.html", "id": "1g3pofm", "created_utc": 1728937199.0, "score": 916, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 242, "comments": [{"body": "Sold some at $139 today.

If someone comes along with a limit order for $10, it will get filled at a lower price.

If someone were to walk in and try to buy NVDA at a valuation of $3.4 Trillion today, they'd not be able to.

(That's why actual offers to buy companies on the public market pretty much always come in above the current share price)\n\nIt's important to remember, market cap is only the \"best\" metric for a companies actual value in a given moment. Nobody knows the actual value, hell, there is no actual value. That's like asking the price of a painting up for auction before the auction starts. A very important purpose of markets is to help find agreed upon values\n\n\n>  It might have been the wrong place to ask looking at the downvotes but it was just a thought that came up and wanted to discuss it.\n\nIt's a reasonable and good question for a beginner.

{"title": "I sold my Tesla shares and here\u2019s why", "selftext": "Tesla\u2019s stock price depends on it \u201cnot being a car company\u201d. Usually people have pointed to it being an \u201cenergy\u201d company or an \u201cAI\u201d company where the market potential in either sector is huge. The problem is I don\u2019t have any evidence of anyone else at the company aside from Elon driving this vision. Ever since Tesla almost went bankrupt my impression is the company is largely built around reacting to Elon\u2019s direction, which was fine when Elon was largely focusing on Tesla. However it seems quite clear that Elon, who is a very \u201cmission\u201d driven individual, has other missions such as \u201cprotect free speech\u201d, \u201cdestroy the work mind virus\u201d, and \u201cextend humanity beyond Earth\u201d that are much more important and interesting to him than dominate the energy sector. AI is also interesting to him, though it\u2019s not quite clear to what end, and in theory that should bode well for Tesla as he previously touted Tesla as having amazing AI capabilities because of FSD. However more and more it seems that he\u2019s putting his AI initiatives beyond FSD in xAI. To the extent that I was surprised when he was previously polling on X whether Tesla should invest I think it was 5B in xAI at what I imagine would be an unreasonable valuation at probably a minority ownership. Why is he doing this? Why didn\u2019t he put xAI under Tesla from the beginning? The reason is control. At this point in Elon\u2019s life he doesn\u2019t want to spend much time on something he can\u2019t fully control, and with Tesla as a listed company it will always be both 1) at risk of loss of control  and 2) just in general annoying to administer - even if he has control there will always be more hoops to jump through, which he hates, compared to a private company.\n\nSo what is Tesla now to Elon? It\u2019s his cash cow to fund his other initiatives. And without him focusing on Tesla, and without other competent leadership at the company to drive these ambitious initiatives, all of these ambitious projects that are still a long way from completion, will be more akin to ambitious projects at Google. Robotaxis looks more like Google Glass than Starlink.\n\nSo that\u2019s it, I think Tesla will chug along and Elon will involve in Tesla mainly to the extent of reacting to keeping the stock price reasonable. Currently the price is inflated based on people going \u201che did XYZ at other companies so don\u2019t underestimate him on Tesla\u201d. But for the reasons I mentioned above despite Elon\u2019s successes elsewhere it\u2019s not going to happen at Tesla.\n\nWould love to hear what others think.", "id": "1g3b8zi", "created_utc": 1728895418.0, "score": 258, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 400, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m a diehard Tesla fan and investor and agree with a lot of your points.

For Tesla, adopting this technology would bring several advantages:\n\n- Improved Performance and Responsiveness: SBW allows for more precise control and real-time adjustments of steering inputs. It can dynamically adjust steering ratios based on driving conditions, offering better handling at high speeds and easier maneuvering at low speeds.\n- Enhanced Autopilot Capabilities: Tesla\u2019s self-driving features could benefit greatly from SBW. By removing mechanical components, Tesla could fine-tune the steering response for autonomous driving, ensuring smoother and more accurate lane changes, turning, and parking.\n- Weight and Space Reduction: SBW eliminates the need for mechanical components like the steering column, which reduces the vehicle\u2019s weight and frees up interior space. This could further enhance Tesla\u2019s electric range and improve efficiency.\n-Increased Flexibility in Cabin Design: Without the need for a traditional steering column, Tesla could explore innovative interior designs, including retractable or repositionable steering wheels. This could also pave the way for future fully autonomous vehicles where the driver may not always need manual control.\n- Safety Enhancements: SBW can introduce additional layers of safety by allowing electronic overrides in case of emergencies, such as rapid lane correction or obstacle avoidance. The system can also be more easily integrated with other driver assistance systems.\n- Reduced Wear and Maintenance: With fewer mechanical parts, SBW systems reduce the need for regular maintenance, which aligns with Tesla\u2019s goal of lowering long-term ownership costs for its customers.", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "Did you chat gpt this lol?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, because its saves me a shit ton of time having to typing it all.

So now the idea is to build cybertaxi at very low volumes until they hit FSD unsupervised and the investment in AI can be reallocated to cars again. Elon seems to think cybertaxi will be bigger than anything, but i disagree and i think he misunderstands the regulatory hurdles along with the change that will need to happen with the American car culture.

Same with model Y.  We all learned that back during model S and model X ramp.  Did it overheat past where we expected (1500% was way lower than most of our returns, FYI), sure.

Absolutely.  \n  \nDon't speak for your TSLA elders, 2018 makes you a youngling.\n\n---------------  \n  \nRight now, there are no in progress factory ramps, there's cybertruck and semi for product ramps, sure, but cybertruck is scheduled as \\~100k per year, and semi lower than that.  This means minimal bottom line change, and minimal capacity change.  All of the reasons we knew what the outcome would look like back in 11-22 are currently missing.  Even if they hit FSD AI right now, this moment today, they cannot produce a large number more vehicles than they are right now.

If I hadn\u2019t used other shares given to me at work and bought at 152.00 average then I\u2019d have left long ago. I still believe Tesla can succeed but I\u2019m not sure they can do it with the man in charge. I realize people here love them some Elon, except those who just want to make some money on their investments, so come at me bro I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019m a TSLA investor who bought in before I realized this guy would buy a social media platform on accident in one of the worst deals\u2026 no the worst deal this guy has ever done. He\u2019s going to have to cash out shares or otherwise divert TSLA money to Twitter. We don\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to do something so insane that it would cost government contracts and access to low earth orbit or FCC frequencies. He can be a Republican, who cares, but this very public disaster that is playing out and costing US car sales issues. I guarantee Q4 deliveries are going to be the worst ever in the US. I\u2019m not basing this on theory just leftists and centrists that are done with Elon and don\u2019t want to be done with Tesla are still making the choice to switch brands. I\u2019m in a very red state so listening to the right say they won\u2019t buy electric cars from anyone, ever (70% official number), tells me that we have a serious problem as my friends who are largely centrists are switching or refusing to upgrade while other companies work on infrastructure. It\u2019s not FSD they want, I have 9 friends who own a Tesla and two of us use FSD, the rest can afford it and outright think it\u2019s terrible which I find odd but they do live in major metro cities that haven\u2019t been fully mapped like Robotaxi has access to. \n\nTesla is setup for major success and will soon be setup to be the only car company that is basically farm to table US and that\u2019s absolutely the best thing ever which is a big reason I\u2019ll likely upgrade my highland when there is finally another good option for a small performance car. If the M3P can\u2019t take Hyundai around a track then maybe once they lease FSD as they have to do (wait for Q4 and Q1) or wait until China kicks Tesla out or suspends operations due to 100% tariffs on their cars which the CCP will 1,000% retaliate against, it\u2019s going to cause an extreme need to realize income from software only. Maybe that\u2019s actually the solution, to take charging (already happening) and let anyone in removing the largest advantage Tesla has and will have for the foreseeable future. I need to see the profit coming from allowing other EVs to use their chargers. \n\nTesla can succeed if they can hire the best engineers but the smartest people I know in information technology of any specialty refuse to work for any Elon company. They don\u2019t believe in working 18 hours a day for an extra 20%. They don\u2019t want to work at places that they could be in a massive layoff at anytime. This is also why other large companies are losing top tier engineers. Tesla should be done with FSD but the one thing Elon never talks about slowing progress are due to people quitting from key positions because Elon likes to think that there are no key positions or people who can\u2019t be replaced. Yes everyone including Elon is replaceable but by someone as good? That\u2019s the question we never ask when someone says that bs. Tesla is literally on autopilot and doesn\u2019t need more false promises. The market reacted poorly to 10/10 because all we got was what we knew and it\u2019ll happen in 2027 or 2037 we have no clue. I\u2019m an investor not a fan of any CEO but I do love that my best performing companies don\u2019t have leaders that spend all day on X. Do like me, the next time your FSD almost kills your and it asks for feedback just say, \u201ccheck the footage and tell Elon to get off X and get this crap fixed\u201d. \n\nTL;DR- Elon is murdering the company he purchased (yeah he didn\u2019t create the roadster ground up) and of course he\u2019s killing X. I\u2019ll hand it to you that it\u2019s his company to destroy (not talking to OP) but it\u2019s our money that will go up in flames. Be careful. Maybe take a 2x gain and run or don\u2019t but it\u2019s getting weird out there. We had it with Elon and now we are losing it because he lost it, literally. I guess when he falls victim to another famous ketamine death causing more FDA regulations on a life saving medication, then Tesla could go down the line of succession and we\u2019ll be fine. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "While your thesis is logical - it is not relevant to the current milestone: FSD is practically solved (test the latest) and the new giga computer is going to finish it up in a few months.

It has been a tough 2 years for all auto except the cheap car brands. Some will argue legacy auto been doing good, but only because they been selling to dealerships with empty lots until recently. Interest rates come down and when recession is past, people start buying cars again. Tesla compact car starts production in first half of 2025, this should be reaffirmed on Q3 earnings call. Tesla does not talk about it because of the osborn effect.  China sales are going up, EU is down as they as parts of EU are in recession, and US is waiting for their recession.\n2. Energy. This is the fasted part of the business growing. In 2023 generated $6 billion revenue and in 2024 will come in around $10 billion revenue with around 25% gross margin. China megapack factory starts production in Q1 2025 which doubles or more the current capacity of megapacks. Energy for 2025 I think will land around $15 billion with 27% margin.\n3. Services. Growth will be 20-25% I think YoY. More EVs on the road means more using super chargers, more 4 year warranties expire means more are paying for repairs instead of Tesla. This will continue to grow.\n4. Robotaxi. Starting up in Texas and Cali next year, though will not have an impact on earnings for a while, it will move the stock up once it starts. Robocab starts production once robotaxi has expanded to enough states, but us 3/Y until then.\n5. Optimus. No sales to others until 2026 but Tesla is currently using at least a few in their factory and said to have a couple thousands by end of 2025, while does not generate revenue, it will lower costs to build EVs which improves margins.\n6. Tesla semi. While not a big affect for a while, each warehouse that uses them will also need a megapack, super chargers, and likely solar panels install.\n7. The AI SaaS business that is part of everything Tesla is making. AI in energy storage, in EVs, in Optimus and the AI services that Tesla may offer at some point.\n\nI focus on the business and don't let the non-Tesla stuff distract me from what the business is doing. The last 4 years are like 2015-2019, the stock goes nowhere but the company continues to develop the business. Tesla is disrupting many huge industries and analysts are having a hard time understanding what Tesla is doing.\n\nI have no concerns on what Tesla is doing.

Post pandemic they could again hire roughly the same amount of people. \n\nNow after having a return to cash flow year in 2023 (also reflected in return of the stock) the door plug event happened which set of a media and political shitstorm and self inflicted quality control and lesser production, which management under Dave Calhoun kept well below the proposed quantities of FAA per month.

It is nonsense!\n\nStop trying to connect dots of old damn happenings to recent issues when we live in the now and work towards a future (which we either invest and believe in or don\u2019t).
