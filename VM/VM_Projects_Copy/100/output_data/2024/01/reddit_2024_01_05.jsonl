That\u2019s before we get into the fact that they arnt even building the new top of the line chips here, they are keeping those back in Taiwan. Why?

If anything I'd trust AMD to create their own in-house chips before Intel is even anywhere close to a 5nm wafer. I get where you're coming from but sadly I think you're miscalculating. The only reason that fab is taking longer to make is basically due to the lack of skilled workers who build clean rooms. You know a room with 0 static charge so the wafers don't get destroyed during the manufacturing process. \n\nIt is a lot of work and to do it right takes time. The second part of why their manufacturing will be lower is again the lack of skilled workers.

That would be using current technology. They would do so at worse efficiency and with more expenses.\n\nYou also may want to do a bit more digging on TSM delays. That is not the only reason they are suffering delays. Turns out business in Taiwan when you are a quasi state entity is easier then business in the US when you arnt. TSM is experiencing culture pains. Turns out you can\u2019t build shit in the US without labor unions, labor unions that don\u2019t exist in Taiwan. \n\n\u201cTSMC Chairman Mark Liu said on a conference call that in addition to a worker shortage, TSMC is experiencing other setbacks in the US.

It\u2019s not just about end point manufacturing. The DOD wants everything. They want to be able to oversee every aspect of manufacturing from its source ingredient locations to the way that material is moved to the factory and every step of the way.

They\u2019d have to fully abandon the MCU to get over superhero fatigue which they won\u2019t do, their only real option is to massively ramp down production of Marvel content to maybe 2 films a year.  I think this video is (automod removes youtube links, the video is Schafrillas - How disney plus is damaging disneys brand) pretty accurate as to what Disney\u2019s problem is.  But essentially he says that because of Disney Plus they are making lots of content to fill up the streaming platform and attract new users, but a lot of the stories they are making don\u2019t have enough depth to be 8 hours of TV show and are better suited to a 90 minute movie.  And as well people are put off from going to the movie theatre to see a new marvel film when they know that they haven\u2019t seen the 3 mediocre Disney Plus shows and watched the 4 Marvel movies that are required to have any idea what\u2019s going on.  They took the MCU to the extreme and people can\u2019t be bothered to keep up with it anymore.  As well, the video mentions how people think \u201cWhy should I go to the cinema and watch this movie today, when I know it will be on Disney+ in 2 months anyway\u201d.\n\nIf you look at the release of Haunted Mansion as well, it released on July 28th.

But hang on, just over 2 months after Haunted Mansions theatrical release, on October 3rd, it is released on Disney+.  Huh, I would have thought they\u2019d make more money releasing it in cinemas in October.\n\nDisney\u2019s main priority is Disney+, and it\u2019s affecting all their other releases.  The best thing for Disney\u2019s box office is to delete Disney+.  They should just focus on making movies and TV shows, getting that theatrical release money and working with other companies to distribute their movies (like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+ etc.). Then they don\u2019t have to fuck up their own releases and they are still getting paid for the streaming rights.

I won't go into any hard numbers, as I can't keep them in my mind, but that's easy to check.\n\nHere it goes.\n\nFirst, it seems to me the proxy battle is forcing them to make tough decisions they might not have otherwise. So it's having a good effect, even if it means a degree of uncertainty for the short term.\n\nI mean, the whole point of the proxy attack is that Peltz and Perlmutter say the Disney board is too \"cozy\" with Iger to present any meaningful checks and balances \u2014 but even without getting his people on the board (yet), Peltz seems to be acting as precisely that check and balance. Iger takes credit for everything, but the fact is the cost-cutting, the bringing back of the dividend, and the move away from involvement in Florida politics (with Iger recently saying they don't want to \"lose focus\" with politics\") \u2014 all of those were Peltz suggestions earlier on in the year.\n\nAdded to this, it's a year of other much-needed changes. Please feel free to counter any of the below, but this is currently what I see as promising:\n\nRegarding their entertainment division, they cleaned 2024 of superhero films except for Deadpool, which is widely expected to be a hit. This gives a much-needed pause, and hopefully a correction from the splurging-$250 million-on-the-marvels kind of mistake they've been making.\n\nTheir remaining 2024 slate overall looks nice to me (Planet of the Apes and Wish 2 I think will do well; not so sure about the Lion King sequel, but that also seems to me a much less problematic live remake than some in their recent slate, and if it doesn't absolutely suck I think it'll do well). Disney+ has been adding subscribers and is set to be profitable in 2024 \u2014 they have had good recent success with the Percy Jackson series, Loki 2 seems to have been a good enough hit, etc. The merger with Hulu will also start showing fruits next year. As of September last, YouTube and Netflix had the largest shares of US TV screen time per person (9% and 7.8%). Disney+ had 1.9%. Hulu had a solid 3.6%, as much as AmazonPrime. With the merger, if they don't screw things up (and they seem to be taking it nice and slow, so I'm hopeful that'll be the case,) they'll have a nice 5.5%, meaning they suddenly are third in the streamers list, after YT and Netflix \u2014 and that's before any further Disney+ growth.\n\nThere's more, but overall I'm kind of optimistic on their streaming future.\n\nRegarding the sports division, it seems to me they're doing a well-thought-out transitioning of ESPN to streaming \u2014 this could be very big. They're investing heavily on that (see yesterday's 8-year agreement with the NCAA as an example). I don't know much else, to be honest. It just looks good overall \u2014 feel free to correct me.\n\nFinally, regarding the parks division, they're having great attendance (in spite of what some social media would have you believe, based off a few insanely hot days in July) and they're making some people-pleasing changes (doing away with some reservations systems, bringing back their popular dining plan, and so on.)\n\nWell, I could probably have done a more organized write-up, but it's much harder to be brief and to the point than just type a lot. Hopefully some of this makes sense. Let me know what you think!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your thoughts.  I do not think this changes my mind.\n\nLet's get going with one spot that I absolutely agree with: Peltz is absolutely a great thing for Disney.  Once he is on the board, I expect Iger to be forced out within a year.  Iger is 100% percent responsible for the chaos that has erupted at Disney.  If he had been smart, he would not have come back.\n\nBut now I have some disagreements.\n\nIger made the right noises about getting out of politics, but I have yet to see concrete evidence of this.  When the political hacks are all sent packing from Disney, I'll start believing.  Until then, it's just a smokescreen.\n\nThe 2024 slate is not great.  It is, in fact, an absolute tribute to everything wrong with Disney.  Sequels, remakes, reboots, oh my!\n\nDisney+ is adding subscribers?  Where did you get \\*that\\* from?  They are down 10% from a year ago.\n\nYou mentioned Hulu.  You are aware of that financial disaster hanging around Disney's neck, right?\n\nLoki 2 is a very rare success story for Disney.  They need to have more -- much more -- in order to get subscriber rates to start climbing again.\n\nWhy do you think their ESPN moves are good?  I do not follow this particular part of Disney, but it looks just like average kinds of moves to follow the viewers.  Not bad, but not great.  Just average.\n\nThe parks are in trouble.  They are fueled by Disney's image and their characters.  Both have taken a major hit and will require a decade to reverse.  The most worrying signs are just how tepid Disney fans have become over the parks.  The prices are outrageous.\n\nThat said, I don't disagree that they are finally making some good decisions in the parks.  I just do not see this having a positive effect for a very long time.  In fact, I think we may see some major dips in attendance going forward, even if Disney keeps making the right moves.\n\nMy wife and I have been to both Disneyland in Paris for 4 days and Disney World in Florida for 7 days.  We dropped a \\*lot\\* of money there, staying at the nicer hotels and getting the deluxe dining.  Hell, we even toyed (the place with all the animals right there had us intrigued :) ) with the idea of getting a Disney timeshare, that is how much we were into Disney at the time.  But this was a decade ago.  We have no plans to ever go back, and it will take a \\*huge\\* improvement for us to do so.  So it is not like I just hate Disney; I don't.  But the leadership at Disney needs an enema.  Then maybe we might see a return to Disney doing what it does best.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate your answer! Let me try to counter some of your points, in case you want to continue this conversation (I know I do).\n\nRegarding Iger and politics, agreed. Still too early to be very confident\u2014I think so far we've just had positive signals. I'm just hopeful.\n\nRegarding the 2024 slate: sequels aren't bad per se. In fact, several of the most profitable big releases in 2023 were sequels (Guardians 3, John Wick 4, The Equalizer 3, Across the Spider-verse, etc. Both Deadpool 3 and Planet of the Apes fall into similar categories, I think, of promising sequels that can deliver a big profit. Deadpool 3 has a LOT going on for it and the internet hype is unbelievable; given that it's kept the original writing and directing team, not to mention the fact it's a No Way Home-level crossover event, I think no amount of superhero fatigue is going to keep this film down. Compare Twitter sentiment re: Deadpool as opposed to The Marvels, for instance: It's overwhelmingly positive, whereas for The Marvels it was overwhelmingly negative. Planet of the Apes is a minor event, but again, it's a Fox production that's largely untouched by Disney. I'm willing to be it'll be a solid film. Like I said, Inside Out 2 and Lion King are less certain, but I'm still confident in them, whereas this year I easily predicted The Little Mermaid and Wish would disappoint.\n\nRegarding Disney+, they added 7.5 million subscribers in Q3. Sure, they're down from 2022, but I don't take that to mean a lot, given their recent trajectory and given the competition with other streamers. And sure, the Hulu bet is a huge short-term cost, but the streaming wars will be coming to an end soon and you can be one of the players left standing will be Disney/Hulu, (alongside Netflix and probably Prime). You said Loki 2 is a rare success, but Percy Jackson got a 13+ million audience in its first few days alone. What If season 2 was also big. Sure, there is a huge content problem with putting out poorly written stuff like pretty much every other MCU show and half of their Star Wars shows. Not saying there aren't issues, just that I think it's not doing terribly as the usual YouTuber suspects with an agenda would have you believe.\n\nRegarding the parks, why do you say they're in trouble or that fans are \"tepid\"? They raised the prices considerably and still the crowds are huge, in fact the December 2023 peak seems to have been bigger than the Dec 2022 one. They still own some of the most popular characters for Millenials as well as Gen Z, which guarantees a powerful nostalgia effect going forward decades. I don't think their parks are going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nFinally, regarding Peltz... you think he'll actually make it to the board and manage to oust Iger? I think that's looking increasingly remote, especially after this week's developments.\n\nAnyways, thanks for the convo, I do appreciate a good exchange that helps me find out if I'm making a good case for this investment or am just following confirmation bias. For what it's worth, I'm not by any means a blind fan of Disney's. Didn't watch a single one of their shows or films this year, save for Guardians 3.

The tool required for this is freely available and costs only about 600 euros, reports Der Spiegel. This allowed the researchers to read out important parts of the system and reconstruct its functionality.\n\n\n>Researchers Christian Werling, Niclas K\u00fchnapfel, and Hans-Niklas Jacob were particularly surprised by how easily they gained access to Tesla's company secrets. After a so-called Voltage Glitch attack, they were able to access the neural networks running on the circuit board.\n\"I would have thought that the company would protect this valuable intellectual property better,\" one of the researchers said. Based on the information read out, it is finally possible to understand a significant part of the autopilot system and possibly even rebuild it. This could also be possible for Tesla's competitors.\n\n\n>Researchers Activate Elon Mode\n\n\n>The researchers allegedly obtained the examined circuit board from a friendly IT expert in the USA. As they delved deeper into the systems, they were able, among other things, to access a video recording of the previous Tesla owner, reports Der Spiegel.\n\n\n>The clip had been deleted by the system but not yet overwritten, so it could ultimately be restored. The team was also able to reconstruct the time of recording and the associated GPS coordinates.\nFurthermore, through their attack, the researchers were able to activate the Elon Mode, first known in June 2023. This is a secret driving mode that allows the electric car to drive completely autonomously, without the driver having to touch the steering wheel or look at the road.\n\n\n>Allegedly All Tesla Models Vulnerable\n\n\n>The researchers believe that all Tesla vehicles are vulnerable to the attack, as the circuit board they hacked is apparently installed in all models. This also applies even if the customer has not booked a driver assistance system. Outside a laboratory or workshop, however, an attack is not practical, as an attacker would need physical access to the circuit board, disassemble it, and be able to reinstall it undamaged.\n\n\n>However, it's not fundamentally new that Tesla hardware is vulnerable to Voltage Glitch attacks. Last summer, the researchers from TU Berlin were able to hack the circuit board of Tesla's infotainment system using it to permanently unlock locked and otherwise chargeable features. The research team plans to present its latest findings this afternoon at the 37C3 Congress of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC).\n\n\nArticle: https://www.golem.de/news/tesla-autopilot-forscherteam-konnte-wohl-geheimen-elon-modus-aktivieren-2312-180640.html", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "With access to hardware, you can crack almost anything.

The companies currently pursuing enterprise full self-driving packages out of reach of mass consumers, like Waymo, are in the best position to take advantage of a mass-market pivot when expensive technologies like Lidar become more accessible.\n\nTesla hates those technologies because they don't fit inside a small form factor car for an affordable price tag. Most customers don't want to pay an extra $70,000 for a big ugly monstrosity to stick out of their roof. So they invest in camera technology, with the same limitations of the human eye (your car still won't be able to drive in the fog and the dark), and extremely difficult-to-solve AI issues (when the information source doesn't have depth information, and can't see through optical illusions/lens hallucinations, you need an extremely sophisticated AI algorithm not just capable of detecting objects but also working out how far away they are, and if they make sense to be there given the other surroundings its aware of).\n\nCompetitors are working on Computer Vision with conventional cameras too but are also investing heavily in AI that can read Lidar, Ultrasonic, Infared and other information sources that work in tandem with conventional imaging technology.

The promise of full self driving is that cars can be superior drivers than humans - not in terms of marketing phrases like \"computers don't get tired\" (they do) - but in terms of exceeding what humans are physically capable of. Sure, you can stick a second camera on the back of the car so they can see in a blind spot, but that's a very small improvement over human drivers. The end goal of FSD is that cars are able to drive themselves in conditions and environments that humans would be entirely incapable of driving in safely. \n\nWith conventional cameras a car can, at best, be equal to a perfect human. They have the same primary inputs humans do (eyes). They cannot drive effectively in heavy rain, in darkness, in fog, in conditions that humans are also incapable of driving in. They will also fall victim to not spotting black ice, to being blinded by a high beam driver, they cannot see in advance what is coming over the hill, or around the corner, they will not spot the black cat running across the road at midnight before it gets in the headlights. These are technical limitations of the technology, there is no way to expand the ability of a sensor that only collects information from visible light if there is no useful information in the visible light spectrum.\n\nComputer vision is obviously a big part of the end solution, but it needs assistance from other technologies to exceed human abilities. And this is before we get into estimates around \"how long will it take for us to get perfect AI vision?\" vs \"how long will it take for supporting technologies to become cheap and accessible\". Its entirely feasible lidar becomes small enough and cheap enough before computing power becomes cheap enough for computer vision to be reliable at detecting depth. At which point lidar can do the depth perception for the cameras without requiring as much compute cost. This is a problem for Tesla, because they're effectively all-in on optical sensors and are seriously behind on driving models that take in other inputs from the sensors it refuses to put on its cars.\n\nFor some easily digestible sources [this Forbes article is good at explaining why we need more than optical sensors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sabbirrangwala/2020/04/30/do-autonomous-vehicles-need-lidar/?sh=756c6022613f), and I was told t[his Vox podcast episode covers the problem really well](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-self-driving-experiment/id1465767420?i=1000625360694) but haven't listened to it myself, and [this IEEE article is useful](https://spectrum.ieee.org/lidar-on-a-chip) for understanding how soon we'll have affordable lidar.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4578632116317749}, {"body": "*This \u201cpivot.\u201d Is it in the room with us now?*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
