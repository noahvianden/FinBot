But the problem is based on ALL the evidence I've seen, look at a chart of SPY. That's the evidence you need that they are planning on destroying the value of the dollar, and mass de-dollarization, BRICS nation backing Gold, collapse of the banks (that they will rescue, but with new conditions to adopt CBDC) is perfect way to introduce central planning central banks CBDC. There is NO way they are going to repair the value of the dollar. (please checkout this [video](https://youtu.be/RY1ECavKSJU) from KITCO news).

The chance of a recession in the next 2 years is much higher than not. There are only a few people out there saying there is a chance of no recession - but even they all say it is more probably than normal we have a recession in the coming 2 years. The debate kind of has shifted recently to how bad the recession will be. Hell... Some people like me think we are already in a recession right now (last time I check the definition of recession was 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and we already saw that in 2022). \n\nWhat stocks/etfs or other investments should a person put their money if they think the time is soon for people/companies to not be able to pay their bills. Not a technical analysis at all but my local casino is dead quiet. The local bar is quiet. The layoffs in my area are beginning already. Part of me thinks to just buy the short leveraged Nasdaq Monday (SQQQ) - and if anyone cares to know... SQQQ is at a 1 year low as of recently. The VIX is *near* a 2 year low as of Friday. Things will probably be ugly this next few weeks in all honesty. The only saving grace would be an announcement of more layoffs to come, which would spike many company's stock price - until the bloodbath begins and less have a job.

In 2023 two banks alone have failed $319 billion in assets.\n\nOnce again, disinformation. 2008 was a complete financial collapse. All banks were insolvent based on ratios until the feds stepped in. Some banks got rescued so their real loss was never accounted for. In other words, you are comparing the symptoms not the cause. The cause was something like 20% of all homes were not paying their mortgage and they didnt care because many were speculators using 0% down loans. On the bank side, they took out default swaps to insure against losses but as it turns out, the default swaps were also not payed because the issuing banks/holders were insolvent themselves. The credit rating companies were also falsifying ratings on behalf of investment banks to allow them to sell them at higher prices. In other words, everyone was in on it. That was the cause. Basically deregulation.\n\n>We didn\u2019t need to inject the economy with all this free money,\n\nThis is a fallacy. We injected money precisely because we didnt want the economy to fully collapse and it would have due to COVID. Either that, or the mortality rates would have been much higher and thats even worse, for the economy, over the long run. So the choice was pay to save lives now or pay for it over time later with loss of productivity. \n\nFurther at the time, Trump had threatened the fed and basically forced them to lower rates to near nothing even though we didnt need it. This exasperated the problem since the fed had no tool to stimulate the economy during covid since rates were already 0% walking into it. So the only option left was spend.

{"title": "CNBC: ChatGPT is already generating savings for companies for coding and to write job descriptions.", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-for-coding-and-to-write-job-descriptions.html\n\n* More than half of the businesses surveyed by ResumeBuilder said they are already using ChatGPT, and half of the firms reported replacing worker tasks with generative AI.\n* ChatGPT is being used to do everything from write job descriptions to help assist coders.\n* The push to use AI is increasing as companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI continue to invest in the technology.\n\nThe recent launch of Google\u2019s Bard brought another tech giant into the generative artificial intelligence space, alongside Microsoft\u2019s Bing chat and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nBut how many business leaders are currently using AI tech in day-to-day operations or plan to?\n\nBased on new research, a lot. Half of the companies ResumeBuilder surveyed in February said they are using ChatGPT; 30% said they plan to do so. The data included 1,000 responses from the ResumeBuilder\u2019s network of business leaders.\n\nStacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder, said the data might be the tip of the iceberg. Since the survey was completed, more professionals have started using generative AI.\n\nAdopting AI is saving money\n\nHaller said age and the current state of the economy influenced the results. For example, 85% of respondents were under 44 and younger workers are more likely to adopt new technology.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re 38, 40 years old, you grew up with technology in your hands,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is second nature to you.\u201d\n\nHaller said high adoption also relates to the post-pandemic job market. After expanding during the pandemic, companies are adjusting to a new economy through automation, she said.\n\n\u201cWe saw ChatGPT replacing jobs in the HR department first, the people writing job descriptions or responding to applicants,\u201d Haller said. \u201cI don\u2019t know many people that love writing job descriptions, and I\u2019ve been in this world for a long time.\u201d\n\nResumeBuilder collects hiring data to help applicants build cover letters and CVs during their search.\n\nWhen businesses automate writing tasks, it leaves money available for more strategic areas of the company. According to the data, half the firms implementing AI said they saved $50,000, and a tenth of companies said they had saved $100,000.\n\nThe other area where ChatGPT is having an impact is in coding. Haller said companies were using generative AI to speed up coding tasks and using the time and money they saved toward retraining and hiring.\n\n\u201cIf they can generate code well enough to reduce the labor cost, they can take their code budget and pay developers,\u201d she said. \u201cOr better yet, retrain code writers to do the jobs they need to fill.\u201d\n\nShe said it is still hard to find senior developers, and every bit counts.\n\nAI is becoming a hot resume item\n\nCEO Praveen Ghanta founded Fraction, a professional services startup to help tech companies find senior developers, and said generative AI is part of his firm\u2019s strategy. AI as a skillset is already a resume stand out.\n\n\u201cWe saw it first on the demand side,\u201d Ghanta said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing it appear on developer resumes as a skill.\u201d\n\nResumeBuilder found nine out of 10 responding businesses sought potential employees with ChatGPT experience. One version of ChatGPT as a resume skill is what Ghanta called prompt engineering.\n\n\u201cFor example, ChatGPT is bad at math,\u201d he said, but candidates could draw on their prompt engineering experience to know what inputs produce the best-generated results. \u201cIf you say, \u2033Let\u2019s do this step by step\u2019 in the prompt, its ability to do math word problems skyrockets,\u201d he said.\n\nGhanta said the idea for Fraction came when he was recruiting for a previous startup and found talent by hiring part-time developers already working at top tech companies. He found that developers with 12 years of experience and AI prompt skills still needed help getting in front of hiring managers.\n\n\u201cThe currency of the day in hiring hasn\u2019t changed, it\u2019s a resume,\u201d Ghanta said. \u201cHiring managers still want to see that sheet of paper, a PDF, and many developers have really bad resumes.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not writers, he said, and struggle to represent their work experience clearly. His team uses an AI workflow to combat this. Clients speak about their responsibilities to a transcribing bot like Otter.AI, which ChatGPT summarizes into a working resume. With prompt know-how, Ghanta said using AI has become a toolset companies seek.\n\nWill AI replace workers?\n\nWith the correct instruction, ChatGPT can write applications, build code, and solve complex math problems. Should employees worry about their jobs? Ghanta said as a founder, he looks at new tech as tools to engage with, and new skills are always an advantage for employers or employees.\n\n\u201cI encourage developers to engage and sharpen their skills. These companies make it easy to use their APIs,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a company perspective, adoption can be competitive because this is a new skill. Not everybody is doing this yet.\u201d\n\nThere has been a growing concern that generative AI could replace jobs, and perhaps not the ones most expected. A recent study found that while telemarketers top the list of jobs \u201cexposed\u201d to generative AI, roles like professors and sociologists are also at risk.\n\nOn the hiring side, 82% of respondents said they had used generative AI for hiring in a recent ResumeBuilder update. Among respondents, 63% said candidates using ChatGPT were more qualified.\n\n\u201cWhen Photoshop came out, people thought it would replace everything and that they couldn\u2019t trust pictures anymore,\u2019\u201d Haller said. \u201cSince the Industrial Revolution, new technology has changed how we work. This is just the next step.\u201d", "id": "12fnz2b", "created_utc": 1680964593.0, "score": 1761, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 288, "comments": [{"body": "Both the job descriptions and the resumes will be generated by ChatGPT.
