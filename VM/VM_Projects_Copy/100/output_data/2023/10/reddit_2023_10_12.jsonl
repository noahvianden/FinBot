If they lower interest rates, inflation spikes.\n\nBusinesses have continually raised their prices to keep up with inflation, specifically commodity inflation. As they raise prices, they expect consumers to pay those higher prices so the cost of inflation is passed on. When the consumer can't pay, suddenly business margins are compressed and PE ratios shoot through the roof because it's impossible for them to continue making the same amount of revenue in a high interest environment. Not only that, they now can't service any debt they have without paying 5+% for it. In 2-3 years when all those debt obligations start maturing, that will further compress margins.\n\nThis whole rally in the last year was \"fighting the fed\". It was a hopium rally based on the incorrect notion that inflation was cooling, yet if you look at the bond market prices and how they continually fall you can tell that isn't exactly true. Inflation is here to stay. The fed has less control over commodity inflation.\n\nAs you know, monetary policy tends to lag around 15 months. Long term bonds rising will put major pressure on stocks because why invest in a company growing 9% a year when you can make 5% risk free?
