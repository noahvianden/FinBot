The Dow reached an all-time high and Siegel's anticipation of the S&P 500 following suit signals a bullish market. \r  \n\r  \nHe foresees a reversal favoring value and small stocks over large growth stocks. The market appears healthier as speculation around cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and fad stocks diminishes. Siegel is optimistic about quality growth stocks, such as Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Amazon, regaining prominence.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, he expects a 4% to 5% rise in housing prices in 2024 due to anticipated interest rate cuts.\r  \n\r  \nDespite the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, Siegel is surprised by the resilient growth of the American economy, suggesting a soft landing without a recession in 2024.\r  \n\r  \n", "id": "18jp1as", "created_utc": 1702724870.0, "score": 510, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 189, "comments": [{"body": "It should be mandatory in this sub that whenever you post a prediction of someone, you also have to add information about his past prediction performance.

While it's challenging to comprehensively assess the accuracy of his predictions over the last 10 years due to the complexity and variability of financial markets, several of his forecasts have been noted:\n\n* Strong Economy and Rising Inflation: Siegel predicted a strong economy despite rising inflation due to government and Federal Reserve policies [13].\n\n* Stocks as a Good Investment: He maintained that stocks would continue to be a great investment option [15].\n\n* Inflation Predictions: Siegel accurately forecasted higher inflation, with predictions in the 3 to 5% range [29]. He also projected a cumulative inflation of 20% to 25% over three to four years.\n\n* Bond Yields and Interest Rates: He predicted that bond yields would rise towards 2% by the end of 2021 [17] and later projected that the 10-year yield would be between 1.75% and 2% [30].\n\n* S&P 500 Predictions: Siegel correctly predicted a bull market in the S&P 500 in 2020 and expected it to reach 5,000 in 2022, a gain of approximately 7% [28].\n\n* 2022 Predictions: He expected US stocks to surge by 20% to 30% over the next two years and warned that aggressive rate hikes by the Fed could lead to a recession [46], [47].\n\n* Long-term Outlook: Siegel consistently supports the idea of stocks being a strong investment in the long run, despite short-term volatility [55], [56], [57].\n\nIt's important to note that while Siegel has been one of the most prescient forecasters, as mentioned in his interviews with Advisor Perspectives [38], specific yearly accuracy or a comprehensive evaluation over the past decade isn't readily available in the sources I accessed.
