I'm dumb this isn't advice. Not writing that to protect me * I don't believe any of that disclaimer shit is true I'm pretty sure I can legally give free advice to anyone I want anywhere in public I want because this is fucking America and it's the goddamned fourth of Jewel Eye * I'm writing that to protect you because you should know I'm dumb first.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyways, on to your example. You commented 22 days ago, AAPL was $213 per share and it's now $221+\u00a0\n\n\nIf you bought it 6 months ago you would need to hold through a shitstorm but you'd have bought that $221 for $182\n\n\n5 years ago you could have bought that $221 piece of paper from some dummy (me) for 50$. That's almost 5x in 5 years. Going back to the 6 months example, you're going to maybe have to hold through a shitstorm. You really can't need the money you have in the market or else you won't make proper decisions. It's like playing a cash poker game with your rent money. You lose before the cards come out almost every time.\n\n\nBut if you can invest in solid companies and hold? And for added bonus maybe sort of see trends in a particular sector? Maybe you're a gamer. Maybe you're a maritime sailor. Maybe your girlfriend is in medical sales. Use whatever inside knowledge you have and make a play and pick a company and \"hold\" until you meet a pre-established goal.\n\n\nThat's investing. So yes, there is value in holding (though the actual value is realized upon sale merely holding is also value), especially when you have a good thesis (a strong, informed opinion guiding your decisions).\n\n\nAlso, if you invested in $10k in Intel in 2000 you'd have about $4k now, so there is no magic money printer for you and me we have to stay informed and involved or pay someone we trust to do it\n\n\nSorry for the ramble, hope this helps someone dumber than me", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Qualcomm built faster CPU than apple(I know about m3, but its not that superior), they are no longer as innovative as they used to be, they are not invited to the AI party, there is not enough space for everyone to be most favorite company of biggest funds.", "score": -8, "replies": [{"body": "You do know you contradicted yourself there", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "No, because thats first time just for a week now, but we talk about future and m3 is just slightly better.

That's just because I don't know the exact day & time the shares were bought (and even if I did, I don't have the ) Good enough for my \"profit margin percentage\" calculation to get a rocket-ship number, may or may not be good enough for the IRS.\n\nObligatory not-a-tax-professional disclaimer.\n\nIn the absence of brokerage data, the IRS would default it to being entirely profit, in other words a cost basis of $0. So if I made $100K and didn't have a cost basis, they'd tax me 15% of ($100K - $0) = $15k. This is the maximum amount I can be taxed on this trade (if you found a briefcase full of money on the street, the IRS still expects their cut). Which sounds like it sucks, but you have to remember the amount they were probably bought for - say they paid $1K for those shares, which would mean the correct amount of tax I'd pay would be 15% of ($100K - $1K) = $14,850 saving a whole $150. ~~It's my understanding you can use an estimate like this as a cost basis on your shares for tax purposes and report it as such, but since your number now doesn't match up with the IRS and your state taxes is that $150 worth the hassle of maybe getting an audit? Up to you (and me come tax time).~~ See edit 2\n\nWhere it really sucks is if it goes the opposite way and you sell for a loss and the cost basis is missing. They still assume that sale was entirely profit, but you actually lost money which would reduce your tax liability. Same example but other way. Say you get gifted $100K in stocks long ago, and end up selling them for $10,000 but the c/b is missing. You'll get taxed 15% of ($10K - $0) = $1,500, but you should be getting taxed 15% of ($10K - $100) = -$13.5k. They owe you money!!! (well not owe, it would offset taxes you paid on positive trades but it's not refundable so they won't cut you a check for it). In that case, I'd argue it's definitely worth fighting for.\n\nEdit: on the point of the data being missing, I don't think it's too uncommon. Someone else said brokerages used to not have to be responsible for retaining the cost basis info since they didn't have to report it to the IRS. You and I had to keep track of that ourselves (probably on *paper, yuck*).

You also don't have to pay a lawyer to set up a trust, which would be pretty overkill for just a couple of stocks to buy and hold.

They're more restrictive since the money has to be used for education and the investment options are more limited, but on the other hand they give greater tax savings. I think it's worth looking into to put some money into that as well since tax benefits are like free automatic returns.

The disadvantage compared to a 529 is that it doesn't have special tax advantages like a 529 does. There's a little bit of tax benefit since if you hold funds/stocks that generate dividends they probably won't generate enough income for your kid to have to file taxes on it, but realize more than a couple thousand dollars in gains and the excess gets taxed at your tax bracket (the key phrase to look into is [\"unearned income\" or \"kiddie tax\"](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc553)). It's kind of best for long term buy-and-hold IMO.  \n\nSo it sort of depends on what exactly you're earmarking the money for. If you want it specifically for education, 529 is the way to go.
