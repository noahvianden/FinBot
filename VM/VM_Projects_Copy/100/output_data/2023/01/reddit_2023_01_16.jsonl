It is \"neutral\" and agnostic to direction - as long as it does not touch one of your short legs - but you still have to be right. If anything your guess must be doubly correct now.

It cannot go below 3975 - 9.775 = 3965.225 AND\n2. It cannot go above 3984.775\n3. Max gain is realised in closing bell when the price is **exactly** 3975\n4. Max loss is realised when either the price is below 3965.225 or above 3984.775\n5. Profit between 3966 and 3984 is easily figured out on the bell (Homework). \n\nCheck SPX closing today. It closes at 3990.97. You would have lost all your money. \n\nIf your picture was accurate, all traders would have opened such... \n\nWith my proposed wings, you would have made *most, but not all* profit. I don't know since I don't have the data for this move. My proposed move will also very, very unlikely to lose all values. No traders open such because we probably don't have $65000 to bet in one go. Tough shit. But yea instead of going with multiple pairs (10x), you might as well go with 1x but widen the short put and long put, and short call and long call. \n\nIf we are to call Short Put and Long Put width A, and short put and short Call width B, you want Width A to be as wide as you are comfortable losing. Width B should be reasonably wide to begin with if you insist on IC... You can begin moving the untested side closer to eventually be IB if you want to...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What would your strategy look like for more simpler spreads like you suggest above?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You can figure out resistance or floors or use delta. I use delta because most likely these are pretty similar values. \n\nI would see if it is oversold or overbought. Had SPX gone down hard, >0.50%, I would sell put spreads. \n\nIf tomorrow SPX gaps down to 3900, and I had $5000, I would open the following... \n\nSPX: +3750/-3800 expiring in two weeks. You can confirm this with resistance or whatever lines you choose...made up value, assume delta 0.2 = 3800.\n\nBecause SPX goes down, the premium for my move is higher. For delta 0.2 I likely would make like $550. Assume so. Don't go on calculator and argue specific values with me, as they are made up. \n\nNow notice my Profit and BEP. They are less directional than your original move. \n\n1. Max profit is realised above 3800 [3800.01, Inf]. Much larger range than IC or IB that are bound by the other legs. \n2. BEP at 3794.5 (3800 - 5.5)\n3. Profit will be adjusted between 3795 and 3800. \n4. I do not care if it closes in two weeks at 3801, 3850 or 5000. \n\nPoint 4 is what people mean by \"neutral\"... You do not need to be extremely correct (3801 closing gives you as much premium as 5900 closing price)... With IB, you create a lot of IFs and conditionals, and max profit range is *extremely* narrow. It is not true that 4195 would give you max profit with your IB setup. \n\nSimilarly if tomorrow SPX spikes up, you go look for 0.2 Delta for your short calls... go against the grain, within reason... If your medium-term view is that SPX would go back up to 4600 of course don't sell calls. This is what I mean by judgment. You are quite experienced and well-off so you know how the game is played. \n\nRe: \"Neutral\" now you say \"see it is neutral!\" Well yeah, but you would prefer that in put credit example, SPX goes back up quickly. \n\nIn two weeks time, if SPX goes back up from 3900 to 4000, your put credit spread will lose its value, and you can close sooner. Freeing up your collateral. This is delta and gamma playing their role. Whereas if SPX goes back and forth, you rely mostly on theta burning the value of your spreads. You are more on edge hoping that SPX does not close <3801.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45422112941741943}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3531600534915924}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6112249493598938}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8576635718345642}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.66852205991745}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.741997241973877}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4957697093486786}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34097909927368164}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4593929052352905}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4687112867832184}, {"body": "Mods here, requesting feedback on a cheatsheet picture I created and posted to my profile regarding option dealer hedging wrt delta and gamma.\n\nIf this is against sub rules to post here, then I'll remove.  Not trying to profit on anything.   \n In short, I want to release it to various Reddit communities as a helpful aid to get people to understand better higher level options jargon (delta hedging, long gamma, etc).  The post goes through gory detail for learning, but I figure people in options for some time can look at the cheatsheet and understand intuitively.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/someonesaymoney/comments/10dv8gt/options\\_dealer\\_hedging\\_cheatsheet\\_delta\\_and\\_gamma/", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Would have been better to inquire with a Mod Mail, but now that we're here, I'll answer.\n\nFirst, I have to say, the term \"option dealer\" is super cringe. I instantly think \"scam\" as soon as I see that term. Why not just say market maker, which is the industry accepted term for the role? I know you define option dealer to mean MM later, but why even use that cringe term in the first place if you're just going to say it means MM?\n\nSecond, making \"order book\" a pre-requisite reinforces the impression that this whole thing is a scam. You're absolutely free to put all the promotional hype you want in your profile page, but nothing like that better be in the text post offering the cheat sheet, or you'll be in violation of our no promotions rule.\n\nEDIT: Hang on. I may have misunderstood. Did you mean \"order book\" in the imperative sense, as in \"Order My Book For Only $420.69!\" Or did you mean THE order book for tracking bids and offers on an exchange? I originally thought the former, but since I can't find an ad for a book, maybe you meant the latter? If so, please add \"The\" in front of order book to clarify.\n\n\n\nThird, just to show that my comments aren't all negative, I like your honest answers that you aren't going to 10x your account and that it's difficult to find out exactly how MMs are positioned. Kudos for that. Absolutely include those grounding statements in the text post. Personally, I'd go further and say that the whole idea of trying to find trading edge by \"outsmarting the MMs and hedge funds\" by inferring gamma squeeze or Max Pain is more hype than reality. Which, unfortunately, would bring into question the entire value of the cheatsheet in the first place ...\n\nFourth, continuing on the positive note, the summary of position delta and delta hedging is pretty good. I would *not* recommend including that in the text post, since it duplicates info that is in our FAQ already, but a link to your profile page or the full write-up, for reference, in the text post would be okay.\n\nFinally, for the cheatsheet itself, I find it confusing, because I have to spend mental energy deciding if the positions in the first column are *my* positions (I shorted a call, so the MM is long a call) or the *MMs* positions, which means I have to mentally *inverse* what's in the column to figure out how to map my position to the correct row. I'd suggest making the first column be my position (or any retail trader's) and then either a small text note meaning the MM has the opposite side, or a new column after the first that clarifies the MMs position. So basically, add a new first column with my (retail trader's) position. The added column would allow you to keep all the rest of the sheet the same.\n\nMy starting point is not whether the MM is short or long gamma. My starting point is what *my* position is, and how that maps to MM hedging.\n\nSo summing up, as it stands, I think there are too many negatives and not enough positives to allow the sheet to be posted as-is.

That's **AWFUL**. The absolute minimum credit you should ever accept on the wing of an IC, or a vertical spread for that matter, is $.34 on the dollar of spread width.

How can $5.08 in credit somehow become $797? That doesn't make any sense.

That's just because you are using the midpoint of the bid/ask to estimate a price of the IC post open.

{"title": "Why I Love GOOG and GOOGL", "selftext": "( current investment = \\~1000 in GOOG and GOOGL )\n\nI really like google due to two reasons: **its \"conglomerate-like\" build, as well as its experimentation.**\n\nWith major positions surrounding the tech industry from **Google Search**, to YouTube, to the Pixel Phone, to the Android OS, to the Google Nest, to Chromebooks, to Google Drive & Gmail and more! There's so many different areas in the tech space which Google either conquers (in terms of Google Search which holds close to 85% of search engine use according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%20online,share%20of%20around%2084.08%20percent).\n\nGoogle also owns the 2nd most used social media **Youtube**, according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). Youtube maintains its place as \"the place to go for long-form video watching.\" DIY, its on YouTube. You need to learn something? It's on Youtube. They make most of their Youtube money through the advertising, yet they also make money through Youtube Premium and Youtube TV. YouTube Premium is able to profit off of content that millions make and just have to give a commission to the creators rather than using funds before making it like Netflix and other streamers must do for their content. \n\n**YouTube TV** gives Google the ability to compete in the expanding streaming industry against giants such as Netflix and Disney. They have a built-out subscription model which collects revenue monthly through its users.\n\nGoogle's ownership of **Android**, as well as the Pixel phone hardware line gives them a vertical integration in order to have a more powerful stance over the abilities of their phones. This gives them more options for supply chain management and optimization as well as they don;t have to rely on another company for implementation of the hardware itself.\n\nThe **Google Play Store** is also one of the only competitors to the App Store. [It generated 10.34 billion in JUST Q3 of Last year](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/). Several million have used the store in order to install apps, as well as many creators prefer it to the app store, due to its more lax rules on app requirements.\n\n**Chromebooks** as well as the Google Workspace are huge revenue-generating segments that intertwine Google with education (as kids in school are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom) as well as the professional world. While Chromebooks may not be extremely powerful machines, they address a market for the people who simply want a simple computer that they can complete simple online tasks with. Google sold roughly [30 million Chromebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749890/worldwide-chromebook-unit-shipments/) in 2022 alone, showing that demand is for sure still there.\n\nGoogle has **Google Workspace**, a fierce competitor to Microsoft's 365 (Office). While Microsoft does conquer this product type, Google does hold a fair amount of market share and recognition in its Google Workspace (G Suite) product. \n\nGoogle is also working on **Flutter**: an open-source UI software development kit which is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.\n\nGoogle also has several different speculative \"moonshots\" as they refer to them which furthers Google place as an \"unconventional\" company which can use its innovative edge to pass competitors and conquer the industries in which it involves itself with.\n\nHence, why I like the GOOG and GOOGL stock :)", "id": "10dw0ls", "created_utc": 1673911483.0, "score": 456, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 297, "comments": [{"body": "Bought and held 8 years ago.

They were forced to start a dividend to justify holding the stock while hoarding cash (similar to the blow back against AAPL in 2012)  putting it into the value camp. In 2010, it had a PE of 7 while ZIRP was ineffect for the next decade. The trigger for PE expansion was when Microsoft started to pivot  and a growth story was developed in 2012 when the shareprice lifted off.\n\nIf you are expecting a similar trajectory for the next 10 years, what are your expected revenue and earnings growth rates and what multiple would you put on those?", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft", "bubble", "aapl", "msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Thank you.

Just answer the questions quickly and truthfully and directly, in as simple a manner as possible.\n\nTwo is actually one of the answers where Ashok says \"I am not the person studying [...] I am a software engineer on the team.\" Ashok might be the head of autopilot, but his primary role is as a software engineer. I think a lot of people assume the \"head\" of something is primarily a manager who would be in charge of only high level organization stuff and would interface with a wide variety of people and experts and other managers, etc. I'm not familiar with the management of this team, but I wouldn't be surprised if the head of this software group really is primarily doing software development.\n\nThree is that this crash happened in 2018, and up until 2019 Ashok wasn't the head of autopilot, he was an engineer in the team. According to his linkedin he worked on \"geometric scene understanding to significantly improve the performance of Autopilot using fleet learning techniques.\" So I'm not even sure why they're questioning someone who wasn't the head of development when the accident happened.\n\nEdit: also seeing a bunch of comments saying things like \"I've never heard that term, but it's obvious what it means\" ... and congratulations dummy, you'd have a very angry lawyer trying to defend you.
