I believe I opened the position Sept 25th/17 right around where it touched the lower band. \n\nThis is the perfect example of how technical analysis is more of an art than a science and it **frequently doesn't go how you originally expect.** I was pretty confident this would be a fairly quick profit where it would flirt with the upper band within a week or two and I'd sell bada-bing bada-boom. But then there was a downgrade or something like that when it hit the SMA and it has struggled since. \n\nThis is also a good time for me to reiterate, **to trade whether it is swing, day, momentum, literally any trading other than \"buying and forgetting until retirement\" REQUIRES strict trading parameters established before opening the position!!!**\n\nIf these were my first few months of trading and I opened the same position I 100% would have sold after the downgrade and subsequent drops for a 10-20% loss. But since I have built discipline and emotional fortitude I still own the position, but it has been inches away from my stop quite a few times. But don't sell because it gets close to the stop, sell because it hits the stop, no exceptions. If you set a bad stop, that's something to look at and correct **after the trade is closed** not during.\n\nTrading lesson over, this one is a long trade stop at 60 and 64-65 target", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Such valuable information, thank you.

Whereas a WSBer with his 180 option needs MCD to go up 1$ every 10 days (this includes days the market is closed) to make a profit. It's obvious which is the better choice.

If you want to stay in the game of trading you have to go for high win percentage plays. I'd take consistent 10% gains over a mix of large wins and large losses any day and DOW stocks give you that stability.\n\nCompare any of the charts I've looked at above to charts of MCD, V, BA, PG, AAPL, HD, UTX and you'll see why I stick to leveraging DOW stocks.
