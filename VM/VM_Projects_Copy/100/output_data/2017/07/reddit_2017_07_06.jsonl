", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Buying puts has an expiration date, shorting the stock does not. \n\nHere's a shot at an analogy to make this easier to understand: let's say you are a homeowner in a rural town with a very unusual tradition. Each and every night, each person in town has a 50% chance of someone knocking on their front door. The knocker will always request one of three drinks; water, beer or milk. There are 20 houses in town, 6 knockers will always ask for water, 3 for beer, and 1 for milk. As a homeowner you are allowed to only carry one liquid in your fridge at all times; water, beer or milk. Finally, if a you are able to serve the knocker what they desire, the payout is $3 for water, $10 for beer, and $30 for milk. If you do not have what the knocker desires, you pay them $2.\n\nNow as the homeowner you have a choice to make on what to keep in your fridge. \n\nYou could go the simple route of just keeping water on hand. This is similar to buying or shorting a stock. The water will never expire and over time you are expected to make money, albeit at a slow rate.\n\nYou could go stock up on bud lights - but there are a few risks now. One, the beer expires after 3 months so if you don't get any beer knockers by then you will have to replace the beer at a loss. Also, the chances of getting a beer knocker is just not as good as a water knocker. This is like buying a \"leap option\" call or put near the \"strike price\" - meaning close to what the stock is trading at now, with an expiration date at least a few months away. The benefit is that if you knew a beer knocker was coming (or knew the price of a stock was going up or down) it's a lot more profitable than just holding water in your fridge.\n\nFinally, you could do the most risky thing and hold milk in the fridge! This is like buying a call or put out of the money. It's a lottery ticket. BUT, this is how you can make money the quickest. If you had milk and god forbid, the milk knocker came three nights in a row to your house, that's $90! Same amount of money would take a water household some 90 days to make. But there are more inherit risks associated. First, milk expires very quickly and this is like buying a weekly call or put option that expires on the Friday of the week you are trading. Also, the chances that a milk knocker comes around are very slim, as are the chances of the stock actually dropping or rising above the strike price. \n\nHope that helps, lol. \n\n", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Water can become stagnant 0/10 terrible explanation. \n\n[JK, I enjoyed it]", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2769065201282501}, {"body": "Thanks that helped a bit.
