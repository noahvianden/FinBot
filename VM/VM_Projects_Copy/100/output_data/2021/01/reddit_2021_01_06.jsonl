I assume you know what options are and how they work already.\n\nImagine that you sell a 140 call and buy a 145 call. The 145 call is cheaper than the 140 call, so you come out ahead. If the stock goes above $145 and the 140 call is exercised against you, you can buy the shares for $145 each; max loss in that case is $5 per share, offset by the premium you received at the beginning.\n\nLet's talk this out with current numbers. 2/19 145c is going for $2.75 and 2/19 140c is going for $1.87. If you write and buy one contract (for 100 shares), you put up $500 as collateral and receive $88 premium. Max gain is $88, or 17.6%. Max loss: $500 - $88 = $412, or 82.4%.\n\nPros:\n\n* 17.6% potential profit in 44 days.\n\n* Max loss is capped at 82.4%.\n\n* You profit when the stock drops or stays about the same. If you know that it will drop or stay about the same, you know that you will profit.\n\nCons:\n\n* Very risky. 2/19 140c has a delta of .277, which is a rough estimate of the chance of it expiring in the money. In other words, there's *about* a 27.7% chance of getting assigned on the 140c.\n\n* Max loss happens when the stock's value is over $145 and you're assigned on the 140c. That 145c's delta is about 0.198. There's *about* a 19.8% chance that you realize your max loss on the spread. Since that's higher than the potential gain, the gains aren't worth the risk unless you have some kind of evidence that the market hasn't priced in that the stock will drop.\n\nInteresting stuff. I *love* spreads. Even though this particular example doesn't show good profits compared to the risks, there are many that do. You can do spreads with calls or with puts. You can sell them (like we talked through) or buy them and be in the reverse of the situation. You can even sell a call and a put spread together and use the same collateral for both, essentially doubling both your risks and your gains (this is what we call an iron condor) if you expect the underlying stock to stay within a certain price range.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "You can just straight up use delta as an estimate of the percentage chance it hits the strike price?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You can use delta as a rough estimate that the option will be ITM at the time of expiration. It doesn't estimate whether the stock will *hit* the strike at any time between now and expiration; just whether the option will *expire* in the money. However, folks rarely exercise their options with more than one week to expiry, so it doesn't *really* matter whether it hits the strike price or not, so long as it's out of the money again by expiry.\n\nNotice that OTM options with higher delta are closer to the strike price. In other words, calls with lower strikes and puts with higher strikes have higher deltas. Delta also becomes more polarized as expiry draws nearer; an ITM call with one month to expiry has a lower delta than a call with one year to expiry. Notice that both of these factors on delta have similar effects on the likelihood that the option expires ITM.\n\n**Tl;dr:** yes.

I don't mean to talk down to you, but I don't know where you're coming from, so I'll keep things really simple.\n\nSPY is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500. It is stable. It's currently trading for $374.55. The last time there was a difference of at least $40 between the min and the max of the price in a month was May of last year, so let's assume that that's a safe strike above/below the current value.\n\nA 335 put expiring on 2/19 is $2.81. A 334 put expiring on the same date is $2.72, so we make $0.09 per share.\n\nA 415 call for 2/19 is $0.20. A 420 call is $0.14, so we make $0.06 per share.\n\nSo, you sell 5x 335p, buy 5x 334p, sell 1x 415c, and buy 1x 420c. You receive $60 for putting up $500 collateral. If we were right and SPY stays in that range, you made 12% over 6 weeks. That's not bad. As long as the pattern from the past several months holds, we make bank.\n\n*Question: why are we buying and selling 5 puts?* Answer: The difference in strikes between the two calls is $5, so that's how much collateral we need to put up per share. We can use the same collateral on the puts, and the difference in the strikes is $1, so we can buy five times as many puts without putting up any more money.\n\nOne caveat: the volume is pretty low. That is, there aren't a ton of folks buying/selling options so far out of the money. It might be a little difficult to find someone to buy 5x 335p and sell 5x 334p.\n\nHowever, if we set up an iron condor on SPY expiring next Wednesday and set strike prices fairly close to the stock's current value, we could make some money. I just tested it out. I don't want to write it all out, but a 372/373/377/378 gives us $0.97 per share when we put up $1.00 collateral per share. The sum of the 373/377 deltas is about 0.80. That means that there's about a 20% chance of nearly doubling our money in a week, and our max loss is 3%. This is a bit unrealistic; Robinhood is probably reporting the prices higher/lower than you might be able to actually buy/sell for, but I bet you could get a 20% chance of getting a 90% return with a max loss of 10%.

Your wording was confusing, but I agree that selling puts limits upside vs. buying the underlying outright.

If you sell calls under your cost basis, that is a risk that individuals would need to assess, but the core of the wheel is selling calls ABOVE cost basis to either lower cost basis or lock in gains. To say that will ever lose you money is incorrect. If you were to sell a call below your basis, and get assigned, you blame \"the wheel\" for losing your money? No. You sold wrong. You can say you \"didn't have a choice\", but that's an incorrect application of the wheel. Once you are assigned shares, the wheel should be viewed as monetizing a buy and hold position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There are plenty of good stocks with market caps in the billions that don't have very liquid OTM options\n\nOK. Don't wheel those then, but it doesn't make the wheel a losing proposition. Just a difficult one.
