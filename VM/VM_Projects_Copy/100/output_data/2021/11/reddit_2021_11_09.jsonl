If TA is the driver then FA is the cop with a speed camera who will chase you down if you're out of line.  Sometimes TA runs away from FA but that's never done without the help of the last one.\n\nSentiment Analysis, which takes things like social media posts and attempts to gauge the wider public opinion about a stock.  This one is fickle, full of liars and trolls.  However, it can be helpful to guide your analysis towards FA or TA if you're unsure.  \n\n\n**3) Leave your ego at the door.**\n\nThis one might be the most relevant for you.  \nIf you have too much ego/confidence you won't second-guess your DD when it's wrong.  \nIf you have too little confidence you won't stop doubting your DD when it's correct.\n\nBe Confident about your DD but avoid confirmation bias, avoid FOMO, avoid unfounded FUD.\n\nBe Objective.  Take the information into consideration in a dispassionate way and use your chosen analyses to figure out if it's helpful to your end goal.\n\nFinally, sometimes results will have nothing to do with your DD.  A company gets bought up at a good price and you pat yourself on the back, even though it was nothing but luck.  \nThat's your ego convincing you that you somehow earned those gains.

In the previous analysis, we realized that the majority of gains were made from the listing itself and those who invested on listing day gained a measly 1.3%. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/mqaqckgwcky71.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ea35ba0f98fc279ed026f8a25155e7226b2bd7)\n\nIn most cases, [less than 10% of the total IPO](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price) is allocated to retail investors. Adding to this, a multitude of other factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not in the end \\[2\\].\n\nGiven that the chances of you making it into the IPO allotment are bleak, what I wanted to analyze is, if we miss the IPO bus,\n\n**What is the best time to buy into a recently IPO\u2019d stock?**\n\nShould it be on the listing day itself or should you wait a day, week, or even a month for all the hype surrounding the IPO to die down and the stock to come back to its \u201creal\u201d valuation \\[3\\]?\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6r1e0pexcky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68938eda8a8e6584086ea2526191de2780d79d4)\n\n**Data**\n\nI have leveraged the same data source (iposcoop.com) that I used last time. They have documented almost all the IPOs from 2000. But for this analysis, I also needed stock price-related information for periods long after the stock had been listed in the market.\n\nThe stock price information was obtained using Yahoo Finance. After all the quality checks, we are left with 1,063 IPOs from 2000-2020. All the data used in the analysis has been shared through a Google sheet at the end.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hfp6m7fxcky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfd882f472db5ff2b24712d6f45c044dc64e39c8)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nSince the idea is to find the best time to invest in an IPO, we have to compare the returns for multiple time periods. I calculated the one month and one year returns in case you had invested on the day of the IPO as well as if you had invested in the stock after\n\n1. One day\n2. One week\n3. One month\n\nThe returns are then compared against each other to find the optimal time to invest in the stock after it has IPO\u2019d. The returns were finally benchmarked against SPY to see if it makes sense to put in all these efforts - only to maybe underperform the market!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye8izwexcky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=30984f6232e1f112b0c744102ac326753b7ffaaf\n\n **Results** \n\n[ All calculations are done using the adjusted closing price  ](https://preview.redd.it/6p2fjb8zcky71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8ae5dd59fc7b4f35490db939a47910628e35c1b)\n\nSurprisingly, the gains you would have made from the IPOs are inversely proportional to the amount of time you waited for your investment. On average **the most amount of return is obtained by someone who invested on the day of the IPO itself**. The more amount of time you wait for your investment, the lesser your return is!\n\nBut what if you are not interested in the short-term returns? What if you are a buy-and-hold type of investor?\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xb4m0fb0dky71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6de5081e2294013b5f3c0623947618f020fa381)\n\nIf you are a long-term investor, **you would be better off buying the IPO after waiting for a week**, as it generated the most amount of return. But what is interesting is that waiting a week for the hype to die down would only increase your return by 9%. Waiting any further would only ***decrease your overall return.***\n\nSo if you are planning on buying into an IPO but did not get an allocation at the listing price, you can wait a week so as to see how it performs in the market, avoid any large swings that the first week might cause, and still come out on top over the long run!\n\nNow, let\u2019s compare the performance of IPO stocks against SPY. After all, even though you are getting a good return on your investment, if it does not beat the market, you would have been better off just investing it in SPY rather than doing all this research on IPOs.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/22629f01dky71.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=984853c5a19444697739f7f3d7983def43846702)\n\nIPOs\u2019 returns on average ***beat the market*** over the last two decades. The trends are similar to the ones observed earlier with the delta over the market return depending on how much time you waited before investing into the IPO and generating the highest amount of delta by waiting one week from the day of the IPO.\n\nNow it would be amiss not to discuss the inherent risks associated with investing in an IPO. Out of the 1,063 IPO\u2019s in our analysis, only 62% of them gained in value and only a measly 29% of the IPOs beat the market over the long run. The outperformance over the market is coming due to a few outliers (Tesla - 25,000%+, Shopify - 5800%+, etc.) If you miss out on the top 1% of successful IPOs, your returns would be much lesser than the market.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/i454uhfxcky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=46a766012f32cdb317b37001a32f5340b05b829f)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe above analysis comes with some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy\n\n1. The number of IPOs in the analysis is approximately 1/3rd of the total IPOs which occurred during 2000-2020 \\[4\\]. I don\u2019t think this is a major concern since our sample of 1000+ stocks would be much more than enough to give statistical significance to our analysis.\n2. Another limitation is that the delta that you are observing here might just be due to the additional risk that you are taking by buying into lesser-known/small-cap companies. The risk-adjusted return might give a different result.\n3. Continuing from the above point, we are currently in a massive bull run with ATH being broken every week. So the additional risk you are taking will be well rewarded but the outcome might look different if we do the same analysis in the middle of a bear market.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rlcfw8a2dky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8635abccc083367c60b7e03a96ac4174f8045d)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBuying into an IPO is an exciting prospect. Our analysis proves that even if you miss out on getting the IPO allocation, it\u2019s still possible to beat the market by investing after the stock is listed on the market.\n\nAs I [explained in my last post on IP](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/can-you-make-money-from-ipos)O, investment banks are incentivized to slightly underprice while listing (unless it\u2019s a really popular company) so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO) \\[5\\].\n\nWhatever the case may be, if you are planning on holding on to the IPO only for a short period of time, you can maximize your returns by investing in the IPO as soon as it\u2019s listed whereas if you are a long term investor who is planning to hold on to the stock for a very long time, its better to wait a week or so for the stock price to settle before making your move!\n\nAnalysis Sheet containing all the data: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqRNZEsTfgG6f8GfI-n6qBAai9wrUA47hFMYg6tz098/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nUntil next week\u2026\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hekbeva2dky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b99e94f3b6cbf5298ac5beb6158b4fed1b8fb7d)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The company has [only built and delivered 56](https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/) vehicles as of Oct21. If Rivian IPO\u2019d at $65 Billion, it means that each vehicle it delivered added more than $1 Billion in value to its shareholders. A similarly valued Ford delivered 4.1 Million vehicles in 2020. Truly wild times we are living in!\n\n\\[2\\] Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients - [In the case of TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.\n\n\\[3\\] Take the examples of Robinhood and Coinbase IPO. Robinhood tanked on listing day losing 8% only to rally almost 100% in the next one week before coming back down to near its IPO pricing. Coinbase also had a wild ride on listing day with the share price going as high as $429 before crashing back down to \\~$310.\n\n\\[4\\] The major limitation was the absence of financial data in Yahoo Finance for certain stocks.\n\n\\[5\\] There are a lot of contradictory opinions regarding this with [some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275531918309280) showcasing that IPO\u2019s are usually undervalued while [others argue](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/17/3/811/1612977?redirectedFrom=PDF) that IPOs are overvalued. I guess you can twist data however you want to tell your story.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxqqfia2dky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c641542f94fec24a101d78a717b96eb66cc33c1c\n\n *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

How in the world would a real life investor invest in ALL of them (or even a 1/3) to get results you describe.  How much new money is available each day to the investor to invest in all the new IPO EACH DAY for YEARS.  To do this one would need to free up new monies.  Do you sell each one at the 1yr. anniversary and divide that money equal to buy all the ones for that day?

He was right once, was the main character in a movie, and has generally been wrong since.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "People care because the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was such a devastating and world-shattering event.  It's basically unprecedented in our times. The only thing that comes close to it is the Great Depression, but you could argue that 2008 was even more shocking given the fact that an advanced, modern, technology-based financial system came to the brink of complete and utter failure. \n\nThat in and of itself leads to a compelling story.  But what truly makes the whole thing amazing is the fact that people went on about their business like everything was fine, everything was great, and that we had entered into a new era of prosperity where nothing would or could go wrong.  People like Burry were scorned, marginalized and laughed at.  \n\nIt's truly amazing that the mob had no idea they were on the verge of one of the greatest societal disasters of our lifetimes.  They were walking towards a precipice, blissfully unaware, and when the whole thing came crashing down, there was suddenly real fear that nothing was ever going to be the same again.\n\nI think most people around here don't understand just how scary the 2008 crisis was, and just how close we came to total financial meltdown.  I don't think people understand how blissfully unaware just about anyone who's anyone was about the possibility of this occuring. Those who were around and paying attention at the time seem to have forgotten, but that's in part because of the emergency measures taken by central banks around the world which helped pump asset prices but still haven't restored the real economy to normality.  13 years later and monetary policy still hasn't been normalized.  The scars are still being felt around the world.  Inequality is on the rise in the US, directly resulting in the populism we saw from 2016-2020, and where I live in Spain the country has become a shadow of what it what it was pre-housing boom. This is a big deal.\n\nOf course, you wouldn't think it was a big deal if you're just a middle or upper class stock market investor.  You're doing OK.  The crowd marches onward, blissfully ignorant of the fact that the economy and markets are complex adaptive systems that have the potential for failure at any moment.  Unprecedented liquidity and monetary policy do not help this situation, and even Bernanke spoke about weighing the \"costs and risks\" of these policies when they were first implemented 13 years ago. \n\nHonestly, I don't know what's going to happen, but the mystique around Burry is that he was seemingly the only one who was sensible at a time when the rest of the world was marching blindly off a cliff.  I think for a lot of people he's seen as the voice of reason against human greed, ignorance, and stupidity.  Burry was always an outcast, and it took an outcast to say \"hey, what the mob is doing isn't right\".  It took courage, and it took vision.\n\nWhat's going to happen going forward, I don't know.  But for those of us who feel the world is a little more complicated than most people want to let on, and that things aren't always hunky-dory and smooth sailing all the time... well Michael Burry represents an alternative voice, one that's willing to call things as they are, even if it's not always comfortable to look at them that way.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "GME to the moon", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0749271884560585}, {"body": "Burry got one thing right.

That's literally a huge advantage. Here is lidar in the dark.

Another advantage with Lidar is direct sunlight. Have you ever been driving and are blinded by the sun. Whether its in the day time or at night by another bright light source like the headlights of a upcoming car.\n3. Another clear advantage is the accurate shape and dimension of an object and its distance, there's no guessing. Knowing something accurately to 1cm is better than guessing it. Its the different between accurately detecting kids at Halloween in their little custom and stopping versus not.\n\nLastly, camera cannot see through heavy rain, snow, dust, mist, dense fog, etc.\n\nRadar CAN do all of that and it can accurately tell you exactly what you are seeing and its speed. Also now with SOTA 4D imaging radar you can see the shape and dimension of these objects and can start classifying them. \n\nWatch this and notice how quick and sudden dense fog appears and reduces your visibility to zero and there's absolutely nothing you can do with camera alone as it fails 100%.

So they clearly care about distance. Using Lidar would help Tesla have a better distance map with less compute required. Now, is that a crutch? Maybe... Maybe you'll have to get distance from vision ANYWAY because... snow/rain/fog/whatever that Lidar sucks at. So you could argue that if they gotta get distance from vision eventually, might as well bite the bullet now and figure it out.\r  \n\r  \nEvery time I go through this thought exercise I come back to: Tesla's approach is probably the correct one in the long run, but will be the most challenging to execute in the near term.\n\nThe things people always overlook with that is..

People simply can't wrap their head around that.\n\nAlso the Pseudo-Lidar aka Vidar aka  Depth prediction is being done by others too. Its industry standard.
