After a big market crash like that, it's very likely that the VIX could reach 50+, which is extremely high. Why does this matter? Because its an indicator that says SPY options are very expensive (due to the uncertainty & volatility in the markets that happen with any major crash). \n\nLet's say SPY after the crash is 300 and you buy an ATM LEAP expiring in like 2024 with a strike price of 300. Surely with that much time, assuming a reasonable recovery, you'd make decent money? \n\nWell, the problem is that the option would be so expensive that even if SPY is at 500 in 2024, you might only break even or even lose some money. The reason is that everyone know that after a 30%+ drop, everyone knows that there's a good chance for a big move to the upside or it could keep rapidly dropping, so that knowledge is baked into the price of the option. \n\nWhat would be better is to buy a super deep ITM option (say strike 100 instead of the ATM 300 strike) with the same 2024 expiration. It would be a more expensive option, but the premium you pay would be almost all extrinsic value, which means if SPY goes up by 2024 you almost certainly make money. The downside of the strategy is that (in theory) if SPY keeps dropping and ends up at 150 or lower in 2024, you lose all of your option premium...but let's be real we know the FED will not allow SPY to drop from 450 to 150 without intervening (printing $).\n\ntl;dr version: Buying far OTM LEAPS means a high probability of losing money, but there's a small chance of huge gains.

The problem with this strategy is that those deep ITM calls do not generally have as much volume from Now until Expiration, so you may have to exercise your calls, and then sell the positions, as opposed to just selling your call options outright.

{"title": "Return of the Meme King: TSLA Going into 3Q-4Q", "selftext": "Attention fellow glue-sniffers,\n\nIt has been 10 glorious month since my last post regarding Tesla, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx4hl6/sp_inclusion_and_the_tsla_hug_of_death/). It worked out...well.\n\nThe time has come to revisit our favorite meme stock coming into the end of 2021, as lil Tesla shakes off the flaccidity and grows turgid in Charlie Sheen tiger-blood fashion.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\nThese are the catalysts for stock movement. Your personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant, which is important to keep in mind. You are going to be judging how the market and others react en masse, not how well your own blinking 40 watt manages to read tea leaves.\n\n1. **Full Self Driving Beta (FSD)**  -  Tesla offers driver assist functionality that goes beyond the scope of most driver assist programs. Far beyond. It is not widely known just how far ahead Tesla's neural net (NN) technology and software stacks that run FSD are. There are two key dates related to this catalyst. 9/11 is the rollout of a fully integrated v10 release to FSD beta testers, then, according to Elon, the next release will be 9/24 for 'the button'. The button is supposed to offer FSD beta to a wider audience of nearly 360k testers. This is *not* going to be a quiet affair. The more relevant piece amongst our slightly glue-inebriated brethren is actually that it allows *deferred revenue recognition for 3Q21 for collected FSD premiums*. This could be a significant upside surprise in 3Q earnings, which are expected to be reported around 10/26. Some WS analysts will back them out as 1 time recognition, but even they will need to begrudgingly agree that they should have retroactively revised trailing earnings upward if they plan on backing it out. New revenues are a big deal on WS. A potential per share recognition just for FSD of $.80 is on the table, which would take the WS estimates of $1.45 and jump it to $2.25 for a casual 55% beat, even if it were the only upside potential. Even if it were universally backed out, which I don't believe it will be (as it is partially recurring) the headline upside risk is big and would be splashier than a PTA moms meeting with guest appearance by Jason Momoa.\n\n2. **Tesla's Problem Getting It Up**  -  Tesla has had a flat year. After a blowoff top following my last post the stock has lost steam and spent *a full 8 months* consolidating so far. That it is a bummer for the people that held it during that time, but it is a golden opportunity for a keen-eyed dingus with a share allergy. The thing to observe here are the future year earnings per share estimates. They are going up. And up. And up. Like God damned clockwork. There hasn't been a month where future year '22 estimates didn't increase in '21, and the average earning estimate increase in the past 6-months is... 27% (to $7.287 eps in '22). What has the stock done during this time? Apparently it has drunk whiskey and fixated on overly-inverted nipples, from my experience. The stock trades around $730, down $170 per share from its high earlier in the year. Granted, coming into the year with that blowoff top means that your calendar year statistics are going to be fucked, but still, the mourning period is over and Tesla should be hitting on the waitress at this point. Taking a look at the 5-year chart it looks like WS agrees. Ordinarily increases in estimates correspond to increases in share price with a positive correlation. Tesla shares are currently lagging this incredibly strong indicator for future earnings, and historically speaking WS has *underestimated* true earnings by a fairly large margin. 2Q showed us an absolutely insane beat from Tesla, and in 3Q I expect one of the greatest beats of all time in terms of both deliveries (should be announced early Oct) and EPS. Given the long consolidation period, I believe the managed funds currently underweight Tesla will be scrambling to pick it up either slightly before 3Q earnings in order to hedge, or immediately after the beat in a desperate attempt to avoid a massive underperformance against their benchmark from being underweight. Tesla's consolidation and increasing earnings have made the stock a much more enticing future year multiple for big funds that previously would have viewed it as outside of their risk tolerance. mini-TLDR: Funds aren't afraid to buy at this price point anymore.\n\n3. **Reconciliation Bill Passage**  -  This trigger is expected end of September. All federal budgets need to be submitted by 9/15, and then the house will attempt to pass a 'reconciliation bill' for the federal budget that includes a fairly innocuous line item that didn't make it into the first infrastructure bill. A *$7,500 rebate incentive for all Electric Vehicles*. If this passes as currently drafted it would be an enormous catalyst, effectively making Tesla's entire offering of vehicles much much cheaper. Tesla already has a several month long backorder, but if this portion of the bill passes unchanged Tesla gets the opportunity to either hike prices for even more absurd gross margins, or allow the rebates to help make their vehicles (which are already very popular) more accessible, further damaging legacy auto manufacturers like GM and F who are reliant on their internal combustion vehicle revenues to subsidize their EV lines.\n\n4. **Berlin / Austin Gigafactories**  -  Both Gigafactories are currently considered wildcards in terms of WS production estimates. With '21 estimates for Tesla deliveries hovering around 850k units, it doesn't appear to be factored in. In 1Q Tesla delivered 184k, and 2Q at 201k, so it stands to reason that Tesla is expected to hit the 850 in 3Q and 4Q just on the back of production out of Giga Shanghai and Fremont. If either Austin or Berlin comes online during 4Q (or as early as Oct, as has been reported) the deliveries could be meaningfully revised upward, not just for '21, but '22 as well, where consensus deliveries are a laughable 1.15m. If things start to look like these two factories are coming online in October, it would be a significant catalyst for upward PT revision.\n\n**What this means:**\n\nAn absolute metric shitton of catalysts are coming to a head at the tail end of 3Q and into early 4Q.\n\nWS EPS estimates will continue to climb. The disparity between share price and future year revenues will continue to pressure FY EPS.\n\nThis thing looks primed for another breakout.\n\n**What can go wrong?**\n\nIf the catalysts begin to whiff, it might be time to ditch out on the trade, or revise lower. I'll be keeping an especially close eye on passage of the EV incentive, and the news coming out of Berlin and Texas.\n\nVery little value is currently given to FSD in the valuation models WS creates, so I am less concerned about hiccups on that front. I am looking for a positive headline splash there.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI believe Tesla could actually move from its current $730 price point to a retest of $900 during the reporting season for 3Q earnings.\n\nFor this reason I am picking up $800/$850 call debit spreads for 11/19, which I personally view to be somewhat conservative.

{"title": "Tesla (TSLA): buy shares today and you get the beast tomorrow!", "selftext": "# A cash cow getting fatter every day (read the summary):\n\nTesla reported second-quarter 2021 earnings of $1.45, which surpassed the analyst consensus of 90 cents per share. Higher-than-expected automotive gross profit resulted in outperformance. Precisely, automotive gross profit came in at $2,899 million, topping the consensus mark of $2,504 million. The bottom line also smashed the year-ago earnings of 44 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $11,958 million, surpassing the consensus of $11,389 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 98.1%.\n\nImportantly, the firm generated a free cash flow of $619 million during the quarter. This last point is essential as it means that Tesla can generate cash by itself. It implies that in the future they won\u2019t be capital raise anymore which dilutes shareholder capital.\n\n**Summary:** Tesla destroyed analyst\u2019s expectations and made tons of money. No wonder when you drive shit cars that you do not understand the future.\n\n# Everyone wants a Tesla (read the summary):\n\nDelivery and production totaled 201,304 and 206,421 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 121% and 151%, respectively. Tesla reported stellar second-quarter 2021 production and deliveries despite global chip shortage, thanks to the increasing popularity of green vehicles, preference for personal mobility, easier credit conditions, and economic recovery buoyed by accelerated vaccination drive as well as massive fiscal stimulus.\n\nModel 3/Y registered production and deliveries of 206,421 and 199,409 vehicles, reflecting whopping year-over-year growth of 169% and 148%, respectively. Meanwhile, production and delivery of Model S/X fell 63% and 82% on a year-over-year basis to 2,340 and 1,895 units, respectively. Even if this was anticipable, these are bad news as margins are whey smaller with model 3 and model Y than with the model S or X.\n\nTotal automotive revenues surged 97% year over year to $10,206 million for the reported quarter. This included $354 million from the sale of regulatory credits for electric vehicles, which decreased 17% year over year. Automotive gross margin was 28.4%, improving 298 basis points from second-quarter 2020. This is key as margins are what finally determine how profitable a company is.\n\n**Summary**: Everyone wants Teslas and margins improved. At least retarded start grasping the potential of these cars.\n\n# Energy and storage (read the summary):\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenues came in at $801 million for second-quarter 2021 compared with $370 million in the year-ago period. Services and other revenues were up 95.2% years over year to $951 million. These digits show that Musk is now able to use the knowledge developed for car batteries for producing home batteries used for saving electricity in countries where the electricity grid is no good. Moreover, the current trend in the decentralization of electricity production will lead to the increasing demand for such batteries for saving electricity generated at home, through solar panels, or other sources. By also having solar panels, through the acquisition of Solar City in 2016. All in all, it means that Tesla is getting closer to its target to be an ecosystem where customers produce their own electricity, save it overnight through batteries, and then can charge their Tesla.\n\n**Summary:** When some companies sell cars, Tesla sells electricity, storage, and cars. Even the dude buying the Ford Mustang Mach-E will use Tesla for its electricity and storage of electricity. So, I will get rich whatever EV you buy!\n\n# Why you will get rich (read the summary)?\n\n**Production target :**\n\nWhile Tesla has not provided any clear delivery target for 2021, it reiterated its goal of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Looking at the current results (+ 121% YoY), this target seems to be easily achievable and may even be overshot which would give a further push to the stock.\n\n\"Despite minor shifts in the timeline, we expect the introduction of Semi and Cybertruck to be positive catalysts for Tesla stock in the intermediate term,\" Baird analyst Ben Kallo said in a note to clients. He maintained an outperform rating on Tesla stock. His price target was raised to 764, from 736.\n\n**Risen estimates**\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review. The consensus estimate has shifted 8.09% due to these changes. This is key. It means that investors were surprised by the results of Tesla and become more ambitious about its future. Even if Musk promises a lot, analysts are still surprised and raise their target price.\n\n**Summary:** One more time, analysts are asleep. Tesla will smash their boomers\u2019 expectations and the stock will go to the moon!   \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80\n\n# Dangers (read the summary):\n\n**Competition increases:**\n\nMeanwhile, China-based rivals **Nio**, **Xpeng**  and **Li Auto** recently reported sales.\n\n**Fake advertising:**\n\nEven if Musk presented a new humanoid able to do repetitive and boring tasks, some investors were not convinced of the realization of this project. They even perceived it as further proof that Musk is enabled to respect deadlines. For instance, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, in a note to clients early Friday said that: \u201cUnfortunately, as we have seen with robotaxis and other future sci-fi projects for Musk, we view this Tesla Bot as an absolute head-scratcher that will further agitate investors at a time the Street is showing growing concern around rising EV competition and safety issues for Tesla,\u201d\n\nThe safety issues Ives mentions are what investors should be attuned to right now because it appears the government is finally stepping up and taking note of a problem that seems essential: Musk repeatedly oversells the current and near-term potential for his automotive autonomy advanced technology.\n\n**Summary:** Some dudes are heavily buying Xi\u2019s cars. However, Tesla is clearly above the competition. Uncle Sam is starting to be annoying with probes against fake advertising considering the software in Teslas. However, I believe that the government will be loud but do nothing in practice (as always).\n\n# TLDR:\n\nLast earnings show that analysts are old boomers who understand nothing about technology. Hence Tesla destroyed their expectations. Growth in deliveries was massive, profits and revenues jumped. Analysts are not only retarded but also have little balls. Hence, they doubt the capacity of Musk to reach his objectives and others are afraid of lawsuits again Tesla due to false advertising. No worries boys, Tesla is on the right track to reach its long-term goal. Soon we will all have full freedom over our production and consumption of electricity. Then we will go two times quicker than retarded analysts in our brand new Teslas.\n\nPS: I hold 20 shares of Tesla, worth approximately 14,666 USD.", "id": "pj790n", "created_utc": 1630958530.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pj790n/tesla_tsla_buy_shares_today_and_you_get_the_beast/) \n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Puffy_Reality_, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "look at my recent YOLO where I show my entry position", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30013394355773926}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3125387728214264}, {"body": "bullish and bearish so I got both puts and calls.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "How can you make money buying both calls and puts.

It's the difference between the spot price of the underlying and the strike price of the call.  If the underlying stays at the same price, the intrinsic value will also stay the same to expiration.\n\nThe extrinsic value represents the _potential_ upside, based on how volatile the underlying is (greek: vega) and how much time is left until expiration (greek: theta).   When you buy a call, you're basically betting that whoever sold it has under-estimated how much the stock can move in the time remaining.\n\nSo if you exercise, you gain the underlying and the intrinsic value but not the extrinsic.  If you sell the option then buy the underlying, you gain the intrinsic, the extrinsic, and the underlying.\n\nSo my thinking in your situation would be:  Calculate the extrinsic on those calls currently and divide by number of shares under option (100 usually).
