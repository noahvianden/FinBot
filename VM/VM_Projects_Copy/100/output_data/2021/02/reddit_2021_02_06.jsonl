They are a \u201csafe\u201d  place for advertisers to put their dollars. They\u2019re gonna eat fb and twitters lunch in the coming quarters. \n\nC - my second best performer with a huge return. I brought a ton at $48. It\u2019s blue chip and pays an insane dividend. I am never selling. \n\nWells - brought a ton of wells at a great price. Have a nice return. The dividend is suspended right now but the stock will pop once they reinstate it. I may start reading this stock since it seems to be bouncing between $32 - $29. \n\nBCS - holding this until they reinstate the dividend. When they do this should get a nice pop. \n\nKBWD - reliable dividend stock. Has given me a small return and I use it to help pay my margin. I tend to put my money in here when I\u2019m deciding what stock to buy. \n\nDIS - brought some shares when it crashed last year at $124. Got very luckily and wish I brought more. Never selling, super long on Disney and will buy at any weakness. With their IP, Disney\u2019s. streaming platform has more potential than anyone. \n\nICLN - clean energy play. Clean energy is going to be huge in the Biden administration. I put a ton into this during the election. Gotta a nice return, but this will pop more once he starts sign bills. \n\nPLUG - few things a about this stock - I like the performance. It has drops, but when it raises is always gains. Similar to SNAP. It\u2019s a Wall Street darling. It\u2019s a clean energy play. I got in early and have 42% return so far. \n\nT - safe boomer stock. Glorified savings account used for dividends. \n\nNIKE - had a good position, got lucky and brought before the dip before it popped this week. It\u2019s as blue chick as you can get and one of the strongest brands in the world. Oh and they pay a nice dividend. \n\nPFE - this is one of my worst performers. I brought pretty high when the vaccine was announced. I have since trimmed my position. I\u2019m still long because it\u2019s a great company and I think the technology used for the Covid vaccine will bring other goodies. They also pay a nice dividend. \n\nPSTH - brought Ackman\u2019s SPAC as a nice price. I believe he is going announce something big. We will see. \n\nIPOE - another one I got lucky on. I heard SPAC was buying SoFi and I wanted some fintech exposure. This popped during the whole Robin fiasco and I believe it\u2019s only go to go higher. \n\nEXPR - threw $100 bucks at it, and I\u2019m down by a lot. Doesn\u2019t make sense to sell right now because of the small investment. I doubt anything will happen, we\u2019ll see. \n\nOne more thing about my portfolio that you may notice; in not playing the pandemic or reopening at all (maybe PFE but i would invest in them even without a COVID vaccine) My risk tolerance won\u2019t allow it. I have no idea what the world will look like when it reopens. I wanted my focus to be on companies that (for the most part) will survive if we have a market correction, bubble burst, etc.\n\nMy personal view of corrections, bubbles, etc. is that there is so much new money, government involvement , etc. this bull market still has a long way to go.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "u dont sound like a noob at all nice holdings, whats kbwd? what do they do?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!

I am looking to buy my first stocks and I was considering BB due to the fact that their IVY system is going to be used by many of the top car manufacturers\u2019 EV\u2019s. Nvidia has also announced that they\u2019ll be running their self driving AI on the IVY system which I see as very promising. I\u2019ve also seen that Blackberry is in the cyber security business which I see as a plus on top of the IVY system. I\u2019ve seen that Prem Watsa has been betting heavily on Blackberry since September. I don\u2019t see this as a solid piece of evidence in convincing me, but if someone like him has high hopes for it I see that as a good sign. I think EV\u2019s have huge potential, especially with the new president in office and just the way society is moving as a whole.

MOST OF US WON'T SEE THE CHANGES, BUT OUR KIDS AND GRAND-KIDS WILL !!  \n1 - Auto repair shops will disappear . . . .  \n2 - A petrol/diesel engine has 20,000 individual parts . . . . An electrical motor has 20 . . . . Electric cars are sold with lifetime guarantees and are repaired only by dealers . . . . It takes only 10 minutes to remove and replace an electric motor . . . .  \n3 - Faulty electric motors are NOT repaired in the dealership but are sent to a regional repair shop that repairs them with ROBOTS . . . .  \n4 - Your electric motor malfunction light goes on . . . . so you drive up to what looks like a car wash, and your car is towed through while you have a cup of coffee . . . . Then your car comes out on the other side with a new electric motor or component . . . .  \n5 - Petrol pumps will go away . . . .  \n6 - Street corners will have meters that dispense electricity . . . . Companies will install electrical recharging stations . . . . in fact, they've already started in the developed world . . . .  \n7 - Smart major auto manufacturers have already designated money to start building new plants that build ONLY electric cars . . . .  \n8 - The \"Coal Industries\" will go away . . . . Gasoline/oil companies will go away . . . . Drilling for oil will stop . . . . So say goodbye to OPEC . . . . The middle-east is in trouble . . . .  \n9 - Homes will produce and store more electrical energy during the day than they use . . . . It will be sold back to \"The Grid\" . . . . The Grid will store and dispense it to the industries that are high electricity users. Has anybody seen the Tesla roof ??  \n10 - A baby of today, will only see \"personal cars\" in museums . The FUTURE is approaching faster than most of us can even handle . . .  \n11 - In 1998, Kodak had 170,000 employees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide . . . . Within just a few years, their business model disappeared . and they went bankrupt . . . . Who would have thought of that ever happening ??  \n12 - What happened to Kodak and Polaroid will happen in a lot of industries in the next 5-10 years . . . . and most people don't even see it coming . .  \n13 - Did you think in 1998 that 3 years later, you would never take pictures on film again . . . . With today's smartphones, who even has a camera these days??  \n14 - Yet digital cameras were invented in 1975 . . . . The first ones only had 10,000 pixels but followed Moore's law . . . . As with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment in the beginning . . . . before it became way superior and mainstream in only a few short years . . . .  \n15 - It will now happen again (but much faster) with Artificial Intelligence (AI), health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing, agriculture and jobs . . . .  \n16 - Forget the book, \"Future Shock\", welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution . . . .  \n17 - Software has disrupted and will continue to disrupt most traditional industries . . . . (in the next 5 to 10 years . . . .  \n18 - UBER is just a software tool, (they don't own any cars), and are now the biggest taxi company in the world . . . . (Ask any taxi driver if they saw that coming) . . . .  \n19 - AIR-BnB is now the biggest hotel company in the world . . . . (they don't own any properties) . . . . Ask Hilton Hotels or the Marriott, if they saw that coming . . . .  \n20 - Artificial Intelligence (AI): Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world . . . .

(10 years earlier than expected) . . . .  \n21 - In the USA, young lawyers already don't get jobs, (because of IBM's, WATSON) . . . . you can get legal advice within a few seconds. So far, the basic stuff . . . . with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans . . . . So, if you're studying law, STOP IMMEDIATELY . . . . There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the future, what a thought and only omniscient specialists will remain . . . .  \n22 - WATSON already helps nurses diagnosing cancer . . . . it's 4 times more accurate and many times faster than human nurses . . . .  \n23 - Facebook now has a 'face recognition' software that can recognize faces better than humans . . . .

In the next few years, the entire auto industry will start to be disrupted . . . . You won't want to own a car any more as you will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination . . . .  \n25 - You will not need to park it; you will pay only for the 'driven distance' and you can be productive while driving . The very young children of today will never get a driver's license and they will never own a car . . .  \n26 - This will change our cities because we will need 90% to 95% fewer cars . . . . We can transform former parking spaces into green city parks . . . .  \n27 - About 1.2 million people die each year in car accidents (worldwide). That includes distracted or drunk drivers . . . . We currently have one accident every 60,000 miles driven . . . . However, with autonomous driving that will drop to 1 accident in about 6 million miles . . . . That will save a million plus lives, worldwide each year . . . .  \n28 - Most traditional car companies will doubtless become bankrupt . . . . They will try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car . . . . while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels . . . .  \n29 - Look at what Volvo is doing right now . . . . no more internal combustion engines in their vehicles starting this year with the 2020 models . . . . They are using all-electric or hybrid only, (with the intent of phasing out hybrid models in the not too distant future) . . . .  \n30 - Many engineers from Volkswagen and Audi are completely terrified of Tesla . . . . Look at all the companies offering all-electric vehicles . . . That was unheard of, only a few years ago . . . .  \n31 - Insurance companies will have massive trouble also . . . . because, without accidents, the costs of insurance will become cheaper . . . . Their car insurance business model will disappear . . . .  \n32 - Real estate will change . . . . Because if you can work while you commute, or you can work from your home . . . . people will abandon their towers to move far away to more beautiful and affordable properties . .  \n33 - Electric cars will become mainstream by about 2030 . . . . Cities will be less noisy because all new cars will run ONLY on electricity . . . .  \n34 - Cities will have much cleaner air . . . .  \n35 - Electricity will become incredibly cheap and clean . . . .  \n36 - Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years . . . . but you can now see the burgeoning impact . . . . and it's just starting to get ramped up . . . .  \n37 - Fossil energy companies are desperately trying to limit access to the grid . . . . to prevent competition from home solar installations . . . . but that simply cannot continue . . . . Technology will take care of that strategy in the not too distant future . . . .  \n38 - Health: The Tricorder X price will be announced this year . . . . There are companies who will build a medical device called the \"Tricorder\" from Star Trek that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, a sample of your blood, then you breath into it . . . . It then analyses 54 bio-markers that will identify nearly any disease . . . .

Apple does the same with their products (proprietary hardware and software) and they have the brand. But we're not talking about iphones and ipad. We're talking about autonomous vehicles and unfortunately right now they have neither a vehicle nor the full autonomy software. They had plans back in 2015-2016 and then nothing much materialized. I won't say they sat on their ass too long but due to circumstances, it didn't happen and now they recently announced of making a car in the future. Apple can definitely scale their batteries and they have the integration experience from their product lines, but after release, it takes years for refinement, especially without vertical integration on the EV side. There's a reason Tesla started expensive and worked their way down. The original Roadster is nothing compared to the Model S and Model 3 is much better than the S value wise as a mass market vehicle. The demand and the scale of the Model Y will be even greater than the Model 3. It takes years to work through these refinements and finally having the capability to do single piece casting which will pay off massively from a margin and scale perspective.  \n\nLidar is great and has come down in cost a lot, but the issue comes down to retrofitting on every single vehicle made by different auto manufacturers.

Investors buy up condo units in bulk and lease them out, but small players still earn a decent profit even if it's just a single rental unit. It all comes down to location. The more dense an area is, the more demand there will be. If you bought a condo out in the boonies hoping to make big bucks, it would be disappointing. Don't want to share a wall or ceiling with others? Buy a detach home or in this case an autonomous vehicle just for your own use. I like residual income so I'm going to buy a few, run them in dense populated areas and buy more when they have generated enough income.

They will always have their place in people's lifestyle.

The plan was to progressively add self-driving functionality just like Tesla, but designers wanted a car with no steering wheel. This meant Apple would have to release a Level 4 autonomous system from the get go. All of this aligns with the recent rumors that the car will have no steering wheel.

This means if Tesla owns a robotaxi network, most of its users won't own a Tesla or a car for that matter.\n\nThis means \"making some extra money\" makes no sense to the average robotaxi user.

There is a reason Apple is making it easier for developers to reconfigure their apps for all Apple devices. When the Apple car launches, there will be millions of developers ready to write apps for it. We're talking big players here like Microsoft, Google, Adobe, Facebook etc.\n\nGuess who wrote the YouTube and Spotify apps on Teslas? It's Tesla, they wrote the apps themselves. This is the same problem Microsoft faced with Windows Phone. They had to develop Facebook and YouTube apps themselves. Lack of apps ultimately killed Windows Phone.\n\nThat's just the software side, there's also the hardware side. The Apple car, watch, and iPhone will be integrated at hardware level. There will be functionality that you can't get anywere else. For example, I saw an Apple Pay patent describing a drive-thru payment method where the iPhone and the POS communicate through the car. The car has a chip that relays information between the devices. There is not a single company in the world that could make such a system as smooth as Apple can. Google comes close because it has an Google Pay, a popular mobile OS, and an autonomous system. All it needs is a car maker to integrte all of this. How could Tesla compete with this ecosystem?\n\nDon't get me wrong though. I'm not saying Tesla will fail, the market is big and it's just getting started.

Blackberry and Windows Mobile were also big.\nAn innovative product can beat long established players. Guess what Apple did before launching the iPod? They signed deals with major record labels and then released iTunes. Apple understood the value of an ecosystem long before others did. To beat the iPod, you also had to beat iTunes. In that context, Zune was just a me too product. There was no compelling reason to leave the iPod and iTunes for Zune and Zune Marketplace.\n\n\nToday's ecosystems are much grander than anything that existed at that time. An Apple branded car won't be a me too product, because it is already surrounded by one of the most powerful ecosystems in the world. Apple could sell its car exclusively to iPhone users and still be wildly successful (just look at the Apple Watch). It's relatively easy for them to create a highly differentiated product in the car space.\n\n\n>  Like you said, people just want to be taken from point A to point B so does it really matter about all the other bells and whistles of all the apps or do people just care that the car drives by itself and they will be safe getting to their destination?\n\n\nI think you missed the context of my comment.

I get the impression you imagine future autonomous vehicles as being basically similar to modern cars in terms of design, especially on the inside. Maybe no steering wheel and no pedals, but overall everything will pretty much be the same. If you think that way, then I can understand why you see no value in apps and things like that.\n\n\nThe interior of the car will change drastically once cars become driverless. This is why Apple designers insisted on a car with no steering wheel. It's reported that this is what caused drama in the project, but it's the most sensible thing to do if Apple is to revolutionize the interior experience.\n\n\nThe future car is going to be a computer on wheels. This means many of the things we do on our computers today will have to exist in the car. Obviously the interaction model will change just like we went from mouse to touch. For example, just look at [this image](https://www.patentlyapple.com/.a/6a0120a5580826970c0263e949a7b7200b-pi) from one of Apple's patents. That's just an example and might not come into fruition, but I believe Apple is working on a new UX. How do you tell a self driving car with no steering wheel to \"park over there\"? I've seen one of their patents describing a solution to this.\n\n\nThe whole user experience has to be rethought from ground up. This is why I said Tesla is where Blackberry and Palm were prior to iPhone launch. What they're doing is impressive, that's because they're not competing with tech companies yet.\n\n\n> Integration would be great and a seamless experience, if they can keep the passengers in once piece. \n\n\nAs for passengers ending up dead and keeping passengers in one piece. I could be wrong, but I get the impression you think Tesla will be safer. Based on what I've seen Waymo do, I'd say they are the safest of all the self-driving cars that are available to the public at the moment. Can Waymo scale what it's doing? That's another topic.\n\n\nTo put things into perspective, Tesla was working on Autopilot sometime around 2013 and publicly released it in 2015. Apple was testing its system in closed tracks by May 2015, which tells me they've probably been working on it since 2014. We don't know where Apple's system is right now, but the Idea that they're behind is misguided in my opinion. The fact that the company is ready to manufacture a car with no driver tells it's further along than most people think. I believe Apple is going to shock a lot of people.\n\n\n> Also, if Elon can land rockets, I'm pretty sure after they wrote a few core apps, he's going to open up their platform to let other developers write apps as well.\n\n\nThat's exactly what they should do. As we've seen in the smartphone industry, there are cool features that end up nowhere simply because there are no apps to take advantage of them. An active developer ecosystem can make all the difference, especially when it comes to new features. It becomes harder for new entrants to copy a feature, because they have to copy the developer community as well.\n\n\nFor example, we know Apple plans to release AR glasses. They released ARKit a few years ago, now they're planning to release a VR headset (mainly for developers) in a year or so. By the time the glasses hit the shelves, there'll already be an AR ecosystem around them.\n\nThis discussion reminds me of a similar discussion I had about Magic Leap.

{"title": "Weeklies vs 30-45 DTE vs LEAPs - or how to pimp out your theta", "selftext": "Hoy!\n\nAs per the thetagang philosophy, the plan is to sell options and see them loose value over time due to theta decay. There are plenty of other reasons to do it, but the core idea behind the theta play is to let time work for your advantage.\n\nI'll give a rundown of three approaches, and let you make your own conclusions on what strategy best fits you.\n\n* Weeklies: selling options expiring within a week, (0-7DTE \\[Days To Expiry\\])\n* 30-45 DTE: popularized by tastytrade, selling options that expire 1-1.5 month out\n* LEAPs: 1 year or longer to expiry;\n\n**Let's benchmark..**\n\nI'll compare the following 3 setups here:\n\n* 6DTE (weekly), Feb 12 expiry\n* 41DTE, March 19 expiry\n* 349 DTE, Jan 21, 2022 expiry\n\nAnd look at 4 (very) different tickers: SPY (high volume, low thrills index fund), AAPL (solid tech company & growth potential), KO (solid non-tech, low thrills) and GME (the meme du jour).\n\nI will use the 41DTE, \\~0.30 delta as our reference for annualized income, where annualized return percentage (ARP) is given by ARP = 365 \\* premium / (collateral at stake) / DTE \\* 100%.\n\n**EDIT:** As pointed out by [/u/buzzante](https://www.reddit.com/user/buzzante/), this doesn't take into account compounding interest. The quick premium you get on a shorter DTE can then be repeatedly reinvested, favoring shorter DTEs. On the flip side, selling longer dated DTE gives you more upfront premium that you could already reinvest. I think overall compounding benefits longer DTEs for the same percentage returns (like getting paid upfront for one year vs getting paid in weekly installments), but for sake of simplicity and my sanity, I won't redo the math.\n\nThe idea is, if you can get X% annualized return on a 41DTE option, how would an X% annualized return (in terms of greeks & strike prices) look like for a 6DTE and 349 DTE option.\n\nTo keep things simple, I will only look at CSPs (cash secured puts), no calls, margin plays, hedges, etc, and use the mid of the Ask/Bid spread as our premium price, as quoted on Friday's (Feb 5) close.\n\n**SPY** (price at close 387.71$)\n\n41DTE: 375$ strike, 5.87$ premium, ARP = 13.59%, delta \\~0.3, **gamma 0.012**, IV 22%, OpenInt 37920\n\nSo I am looking for a similar ARP for 6DTE and 349DTE options.\n\n\\[..find a premium/(collateral at stake) ratio = ARP \\* DTE / 365 / 100..\\]\n\n|DTE|Strike|Premium|ARP|Delta|Gamma|IV|OpenInt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|41|375$|5.87$|13.59%|\\~0.3|**0.012**|22%|37920|\n|6|380$|0.81$|12.96%|\\~0.18|**0.030**|15%|15550|\n|6|381$|0.925$|14.76%|\\~0.20|**0.034**|15%|4593|\n|349|**430$**|56.895$|13.83%|\\~0.65|**0.005**|34%|<100|\n\n**AAPL** (price at close 136.76$)\n\n|DTE|Strike|Premium|ARP|Delta|Gamma|IV|OpenInt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|41|130$|3.60$|24.65%|\\~0.3|**0.007**|33%|<100|\n|6|132$|0.425$|19.59%|\\~0.16|**0.048**|26%|3280|\n|6|133$|0.595$|26.99%|\\~0.21|**0.059**|26%|4200|\n|349|**165$**|38.20$|24.21%|\\~0.61|**0.007**|39%|<300|\n\n**KO** (price at close 49.65$)\n\n|DTE|Strike|Premium|ARP|Delta|Gamma|IV|OpenInt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|41|47.5$|0.93$|17.43%|\\~0.3|**0.076**|27%|8193|\n|6|46.0$| 0.085$|11.24%|\\~0.07|**0.052**|39%|2659|\n|6|46.5$|0.11$|19.59%|\\~0.09|**0.066**|36%|1130|\n|349|**55$**|8.80$|16.73%|\\~0.61|**0.029**|26%|3894|\n\n**GME** (price at close 63.77$)\n\n|DTE|Strike|Premium|ARP|Delta|Gamma|IV|OpenInt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|41|65$|27.15$|371.84%|\\~0.296|**0.005**|326%|600|\n|6|24$| 3.125$|372.60%|\\~0.034|**0.001**|470%|734|\n\n349DTE: NOT POSSIBLE! For a 370% return, you'd need the premium to be more than 3x the strike;\n\n**How to interpret this**\n\n**1)** Selling LEAPs ~~are~~ is a pretty bad deal (in terms of annualized interest). For a comparative return with 41DTE, your strike price is going to be higher than the current stock price. As in, the stock price needs to swing up for the option to expire worthless, as opposed to NOT drop too much which lower DTE.\n\n**2)** The higher the DTE, the worse the liquidity (bigger spreads, lower open interest, etc). Makes it that much harder to get a good deal.\n\n**3)** Look at the 6DTE vs 41DTE strike prices (for the same annualized returns): they aren't that much different (except GME.. more about that later). So adjusted for risk, shorter DTE puts are more likely to expire OTM. Or just look at the deltas.. very compelling.\n\n**4)** The GME conundrum: if you're gonna scalp the IV, go for where it's the highest; what's more likely, GME finishing below 21$ in 6 days, or below 38$ in 41 days? (the two break-even points). You could even pick a 6DTE with strike 14$ for a 'meager' 77.6% ARP (that beats selling puts on AAPL or KO).\n\n**5)** We are safe to conclude that I don't have a life; and if you got this far, neither do you ;)\n\n**EDIT: Risks, risks, risks**\n\nSeasoned folks are smart to point out that I didn't get into all the risks shorter DTEs pose. It wouldn't be fair to ignore it, so here's a rundown on what might go wrong:\n\n* pin risk: it's tempting to let weeklies expire worthless, but after hours price movements after expiration can suddenly turn against you; while this could be avoided if you always close your positions, there's some extra value to be had by trying to see at least some of them expire worthless;\n* early assignment: the closer you are to expiration, the more likely it is that this would/could happen with a sudden and violent breach of your strike price; as you are going to have significantly more trades with lower DTEs, this adds some extra risk to the mix that can't be quantified with backtestings;\n* **gamma risk**: this is the **biggest one**; this deserves its own post, but here's a solid [writeup](https://steadyoptions.com/articles/why-you-should-not-ignore-negative-gamma-r86/) with pretty charts that does a better job than I ever could; in short, when selling options, you're negatively exposed to gamma; the closer the option to expiration, the higher the gamma, the more the value of the option fluctuates with the underlying stock's movement; a 30 delta 45DTE option will have lower gamma than a 30 delta 7DTE option; I updated my numbers to also include gamma - but I think most people would agree that for the same ARP and underlying stock but different DTEs, a lower delta + lower gamma combo is a better risk-adjusted bet (see GME 41DTE vs 6DTE or KO 41DTE vs 6DTE delta & gamma numbers); in most other cases, shorter DTE plays (for the same normalized ARP) would lower your delta but increase your gamma; it's a trade-off everyone needs to decide for themselves\n* **IV risk/gains:** the shorter the DTE, the bigger impact IV movements have on gamma (see [this](https://optionstradingiq.com/gamma-risk-explained/) for pretty charts); with IV dropping, your OTM options can experience a gamma boost, that can slap you in the face; this is somewhat compensated though by premium lowering on average due to the IV drop; but if the stock price moved against you, it becomes that much harder to roll out /manage your losses;\n\n**EDIT: Back-testing, always**\n\nThe common wisdom is that 45DTE 16-20 delta have been the clear winner in back-testing and has a better risk-adjusted win-rate than any other configuration. Check [spintwig](https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-45-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Prior_Research) and tasty trade video where this the most common conclusion made.\n\nHowever, there is no size fits all; 45DTE 16-20 is **NOT** optimal theta play on meme stocks or for earnings plays (in both cases IV will predictably drop), or growth stocks (where buy&hold beats CSP in benchmarks).\n\nThe only way to settle true winrates is by back-testing, but once accounting for active management, early closing, margin management, etc. even back-testing is just a rough estimation.\n\nI feel it would be irresponsible of me NOT to emphasize the overwhelming amount of evidence/benchmarks in favor of 45DTE 16-20 delta plays - but it's also not an optimal play for every situation, and this shouldn't be a controversial statement :/.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIf it's theta you're after, shorter DTEs have higher returns. Not necessarily higher risk (**EDIT:** yes, likely higher risks, see the part on risks, risks, risks) mind you - if you pick your deltas (**EDIT:** and gammas) carefully. Makes sense, theta works best closest to expiration; a lot can happen in one year to a stock (hit record highs or go bankrupt), much less in one day. **EDIT:** There's this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lajwxo/why_theta_gang_recommends_you_roll_options_from/) with pretty graphs that sum it up better than I could.\n\nShorter DTEs also require more management and more involvement. Reevaluating your holdings every day (if you're selling weeklies) vs every week (with 30-45DTE) can be demanding, especially with a diversified portfolio.\n\nAnd finally, ***you do you***. I think the 30-45DTE philosophy is quite popular with this sub (and selling early when hitting 50% return), but the gains aren't really from theta in those cases (well, a mix of delta and theta), but rather stonks going up. ~~It's a solid, easy strategy, but leaves quite a lot of value on the table.~~ (**EDIT:** or does it.. back-testing results debate this. It's irresponsible of me to make such a categorical statement).\n\nAgree or disagree, we should probably talk about this. I flaired it as DD, but it's more of a meta-analysis of theta strategy as a whole.\n\nEDIT2: tables everywhere..", "id": "le7wjg", "created_utc": 1612648741.0, "score": 755, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 285, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for the great analysis!

The 19 Mar 20 strike sells for $2.30 (40 DTE), a 105% annual return, or the 16 Jul 20 strike for $5.10 (159 DTE) gets you a 59% return.

You wont get $.45 selling a .017 delta put 5 DTE.\n\n So if that's my theory, and the stock price reaches some level of consistency,  wouldnt it be better to bank roll as much of that fat premium up front by selling longer dated options than gambling that you can sell weeklies or monthlies that far out of the money and continue to collect premium? I get it if the price comes down substantially, selling only weeklies would be better because hopefully they expire or get crushed before they reach your strike price.

Since your loan amount is $84,630, you would have to maintain an equity of $42,315.

If we had a 40% margin requirement instead, the equation from the link above would mean we need $84,630/(1-0.4)=$141,050 of minimum market value which divided by 750 shares would be $188.07.   Loan would still be $84,630 but equity would be market value-loan = $141,050-$84,630=$56,420.

You're technically correct (which is the best kind of correct), and I actually like the way you're looking at it. \n\nUsually when you see someone talking about an Iron Condor, they're talking about selling a put credit spread and a call credit spread at the same time. That's when you hope the underlying stays flat. The person who bought it is hoping for the opposite, naturally.\n\nUsually when people talk about straddles they're talking about buying a call and a put at the same time. They're hoping there's the bigly move. Obviously whoever sold it is hoping for the opposite. \n\nSo when I say they're \"opposites\", I mean *only* in the way you most commonly see them described. Actually, for some reason straddles are a little more commonly seen with the full \"short\" or \"long\", I'm not sure why condors in particular tend to only refer to short positions. The key differentiator as you pointed out, is that a condor is built off spreads and a straddle is built off unhedged options. -So the same considerations apply to them as to \"normal\" spreads/single-options. A long condor will cost less to enter but have a lower theoretical max yield than an equivalent straddle, since spreads cost less to enter but cap your gains. The decision is going to come down to how much you expect the underlying to move and how expensive the positions are. You'll pay through the nose for a straddle, but the move the underlying needs to make to max out what meager profit you can make off the position is much smaller.\n\nThe (actual) opposite is true on the short side. Your short condor has a higher chance of loss, because credit spread, but the straddle has effectively infinite max loss (plus your broker probably won't let you write naked options, and you shouldn't do that even if they will).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That was super helpful thank you.

The hundreds and hundreds of years between pan-islamism and the byzantine empire leading into the Serbian empire vs the ottomans.  The has been the front line into Europe for 1300 years. The fight over Kosovo isn't some new concept forged 40 years ago.\n\nNow that you've done some learning.\n\nLets get down to the meat and potatoes of your high horse argument.\n\n**If you pay taxes, you are funding the bloodshed. Full stop.**\n\nI do not know how many times you need to read that to understand. I'm not saying it's your idea, or you support it. However If you are paying taxes are part of the your own perceived problem with American Foreign Policy. If you truly held your \"moral compass\" so high you would of been out this bitch when you were 18. Now you say you are trying to change it. Pray tell.\n\nIf you are truly trying to change American Foreign Policy and how america will raises money for the government to work outside of taxes I'm all ears for your plan here. Do you have a link to your local office you are running for? Are you a business mogul with a lot of power in the corporate sector ready to use your logistics chain to help people around the world?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly,\n\nI'm not trying to be edgy or an asshole, but you are just barking up the wrong tree. You've made a lot of assumptions about my conscious and how I should handle my \"guilt\". I 'm not sure what kind of psychoanalysis you'll be attempting to drum up this time but that is immaterial. It's fugazi, it may as well not exist. There is nothing you can do to convince me to feel bad. This whole \"Cold blooded killer\" sounds like a lot of Hollywood bullshit. I like ice coffees from Starbucks before long flights. IDK what the fuck you are saying with all this broken down by the military bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter reviewing your profile, I see no recent posts about your political movement or ideals you plan on rolling out, just complaints and yelling at men for being \"Machismo\" as you put it. I'm not sure what you do on reddit besides talk about your old fetishes of people fucking dogs and how you feel about getting molested by your sister until you were 9.\n\nIt looks to me like you're here for the argument, not for the solution. In which I won't be responding after this. You'll will tit for tat until there are no more tits to tat.\n\nIf you have a response, please write it down, save the file then throw it in the trash bin. I will not be reading it. Cheers. I hope you've found that family you so eagerly wanted when you were 21 years old, I hope you still enjoy cooking. I love cooking too.

Only by joining together for a common goal can we achieve true equality.\n\nWe should not eat the rich. We should remind them why they want to be rich. This is because they have forgotten. Forgotten what it means to be left out. Forgotten what it means to be an afterthought. \n\nThe awakening has already arisen. It had nothing to do with Wall St and it\u2019s endless game. When all the world stood still and the shelves ran dry of essentials, we knew what mattered and we bought them. Shelves were empty and if you weren\u2019t first you were last. \n\nWhen the people mobilize and demand what is theirs the 1% will gladly hand it over. The power they yield is given to them. They have known this and now we know it. Don\u2019t accept what you are told. Take what you deserve. Take what this country designated for you.

Specifically, I study mentally handicapped apes. In our circles, we lovingly refer to them as **handicapes**.\n\nIf you don't mind, I'd like to highlight a few of our studies. The following is proven by peer-reviewed research, though, the field is quite niche I'll admit, as there's only two of us in the world. We actually review each other's work for publications. \n\n- extremely mentally challenged apes (retarded) are very poor at risk management compared to other Hominoidea. They will often stop mid-banana while eating, only to get jealous of one of their mate's (other retarded apes) banana pile in a different cage, if the handlers are actively adding to that stockpile while smiling, laughing, and commenting loudly about it. They will comminly work into such a frenzy that they throw their own bananas out of their cage, resulting in having no bananas at all . We refer to this as \"banana insana\"\n\n- when the handlers change out from their main handler (whom they have known for years) to a new handler that knows nothing about them, they are often too challenged to understand the difference. The result is them continuing throughout their days as if nothing changed. Other Hominoidea would not cope well in this situation, and would likely revolt\n\n- handicapes are indeed stronger than normal apes, at an average of 23% increase in brute strength. \n\n- handicapes are almost completely unable to detect real apes vs robotic apes. They will often try to interact or will react to ape-'bots' as if they were real beings. It's quite bizzare actually. As normal apes would quickly recognize that the robotic ape was not real, and will often destroy them; handicapes will commonly even try to mate with the bots.\n\n- autistic apes (autist) are significantly better at managing their resources than retarded apes. Autistic apes in fact, even compared to normal Hominoidea, are the first to find new food stockpiles, will spend any and all energy to achieve hoarding that food, typically with great at success.\n\n- handicapes, when restricted to only one banana a day from their standard feeding bin (even when a bin right next to it has many bananas), will often not recognize that they could easily switch feeding bins for more bananas. The feeding bins are literally 2-3 feet away, but they will not switch even when their standard bin has essentially betrayed them.\n\n- handicapes will often assert themselves in a new environment, completely dominating interaction among apes that had previously been in that environment for years\n\n- one side note - handicapes require significantly more supervision and rules. Otherwise, they are just too reckless and essentially fuck everything up. They don't realize that acting the way they do, forces us to implement new restrictions that give them less options so that they will never be able to play games with normal, mature Hominoidea (we refer to these as \"the big boys\").\n\nEdit: I forgot one - mentally handicapped apes often require symbols or signs for communication.

{"title": "Would like to write about my experience with the GameStop run up, and what I learned about life out of it", "selftext": "Hey guys. \n\nI made a post roughly 60 days ago about a 30k \u201cYOLO\u201d on GME. I purchased the 25c 4/16 with roughly 77 contracts. My cost basis was about 5 dollars a contract since I bought before earnings. I diamond handed them through the rough days where we saw GME drop heavy after earnings.\n\nTwo nights before GME took off, I sold my position. I keep going back, and I keep asking myself. Why? Why did I sell? I was so confident this would play out. I Fucking went all in and sat on my position through all of the ups and downs. Truth is, I don\u2019t know why I sold. I believe I was bored, and just wanted to trade something. I couldn\u2019t stand not trading. \n\nWhen the run up began, I felt sick. I threw up, and my body wouldn\u2019t stop shaking. Life changing money for me. I kept checking the value of the contracts that I had, every 15 minutes and counting all the money I would\u2019ve had if I didn\u2019t throw my contracts away.\n\nI began shaking and crying. Hating myself for being such a paper handed bitch. So I went all in again on a GME weekly. I watched that weekly call double my original position, and then eventually ride to 0. That\u2019s right. \n\nI blew up my account. I\u2019ve only been trading options for less than a year but at the top of GMEs run my position would\u2019ve been roughly 4mil.  \n\nI\u2019ve gone from 20k -> 60k -> 3k -> 20k -> 36k -> 0\n\nEveryone including friends and family keep asking if I\u2019ve heard about GME. Yeah bitch, I heard about it. It hurts to talk about. I tell my story, and they all tell me how sorry they feel for me when I tell them I could\u2019ve been a multi millionaire.\n\nDo you want to know why I don\u2019t have millions right now? Because of these mother fucking paper hands. \n\nAs I watch you retards gamble your life savings at the top of GME, diamond handing it to the bottom, I can\u2019t help but to think that you guys are fucking retarded. \n\nYou\u2019re all retarded but you\u2019re like me.

Shit happens and a lot of it is chance circumstance and split second decision making that we don't give as much thought to as we should. The numbers on our screen can definitely feel fake and fun, but it's legitimate money and we're dealing with life changing amounts of capital, both in a good and bad way. \n\nYou're down bad right now, but take a few minutes to be thankful for what you do have. If you don't have extra money, at least you have health, if you don't have health, at least you have loved ones, if you don't have that at least you have the ability to be conscious and think. \n\nYou are subject to pain.\n\nYou are subject to losing money.\n\nYou are subject to illness.\n\nYou are subject to death.\n\nEventually something in life will come that is worse than this situation and you will think back to this time and think how trivial it is. Call up someone you love and laugh about how much of a retard you are. Go hang out with a dog. Eat something. AND DON'T FUCKING TRADE FOR A FEW MONTHS. NO REVENGE TRADING.

{"title": "110%+ institutional ownership or 110%+ short interest is NOT anything shady. What it is is incredibly bullish!", "selftext": "People were shocked to hear \"over 100% of GME shares have been shorted\" or \"institutions own over 100% of GME shares.\"\n\n**\"How is that possible?\"**\n\nIt's actually quite simple, and nothing shady. All it shows is that the short interest is MASSIVELY overexposed, which makes them incredibly vulnerable as I'll outline below.\n\nHere's the simple case:\n\nAndy owns a share in a margin account. Andy's broker loans his share to Barry, who sells it. Andy sees the stock for sale, says \"I like this stock and that's a fair price\" and he buys the stock from Barry. (Andy doesn't know he's buying his own share, but it doesn't really matter.) Now Andy owns two shares and Barry is short one. Again, Barry borrows the share from Andy's broker, sells it, and Andy buys it again. Now Andy has 3 shares, and Barry is short 2. So compared to the original quantity, Andy holds 300% and Barry is short 200%!\n\nThese numbers are, for the purposes of the market, \"real\" shares. (This doesn't involve any counterfeiting or naked shorts at all.) If Charlie comes in offering a baller price, Andy can sell his three shares. That *may* cause the broker to recall the short shares from Barry, forcing Barry to now buy two shares at market price to cover.\n\n[https://trib.com/business/investment/personal-finance/yes-a-stock-can-have-short-interest-over-100----heres-how/article\\_497d907a-5107-5f0b-b983-2a118108a2d2.html](https://trib.com/business/investment/personal-finance/yes-a-stock-can-have-short-interest-over-100----heres-how/article_497d907a-5107-5f0b-b983-2a118108a2d2.html)\n\n**\"But don't shares let you vote in a stockholder meeting? How can one person vote three times with the same share?\"**\n\nThey can't - it's important to understand that *you are generally forfeiting your voting rights on any share you hold in a margin account.* Shares that have been lent have no voting rights. The voting right belongs to whoever has bought a share and has *not* loaned it out. When you hold shares in a margin account, it may be loaned (you wouldn't know if it has or has not) and if it has been loaned you are not the holder of record.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp)\n\nSo in my example above, even though Andy has three shares, he has a maximum of one vote because he only owns one un-loaned share.\n\n**\"This is getting boring, how does all this get me tendies?\"**\n\nNOW you're asking the right fucking question! The brokers can *only* lend out shares that are in margin accounts (often brokerage accounts may have margin enabled). They *cannot* lend out shares that are in cash accounts or accounts w/o margin (at least not without your express permission.) So if we move our shares out of margin/brokerage accounts and into cash accounts, the brokers will run low on shares to lend.\n\nAt first, if just a small number of us move to cash accounts, the effect will be subtle (but still meaningful): as the broker runs low on shares to lend, the interest rate they charge to the shorts will increase. This puts pressure on the shorts to close sooner, since their nightly interest payment increases and so they have more incentive to close their position sooner.\n\nNow, if we ALL do this, the effect increases nonlinearly: WE COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE ANOTHER SQUEEZE. Once your broker runs out of unlent shares (which is quite likely since the short interest is so high), if you transfer your stocks from your brokerage account to a cash account, your broker will need to recall those shares, forcing the shorts to buy! And that becomes a double-whammy to all other shorts: (1) the more shorts are forced to buy by the brokers, the higher the price goes, and (2) the lower the supply of shares available to loan is, the higher the interest rate goes. The interest payment is due nightly and is based on \\[current stock price\\]x\\[current interest price\\] and this strategy drives both factors higher, ballooning the interest payment, which pressures more shorts to close... which drives the price up more, which further pressures shorts to close... i.e. a squeeze.\n\n(I think in the past week the brokers already did run out of shares to lend, but I can't find the citation, please post in the comments if you have intel about shares available for loan or interest %s.)\n\n**\"Wait, isn't this the exact strategy that Mark Cuban told us we should use if we want a squeeze?\"**\n\nYes, specifically his words were *\"Now if #WSB did this en masse, it would be the mother of all short squeezes.\"*\n\n[https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1355170846931886080](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1355170846931886080)\n\n**\"Isn't this the part where you tell me what to do and I do it?\"**\n\nYes.\n\n1. Open a cash account, or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled. All new GME shares you buy, buy from this account and not your old margin account.\n2. Try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account. AFAIK they are not actually obligated to do this, they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell, but it's worth trying. We can give good PR to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares, and bad reviews for brokerages that block it.\n3. If you have extra cash (and if you don't have extra cash and you're here now, may god have mercy on your retard soul) you can set up a cash account, then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price. If you can do both transactions at the exact same price, this is identical to #2 where you're doing an in-kind transfer between accounts. The obvious risk here is that you can't control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell (but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high).\n4. Continue spreading the word - this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts. If just a few people do it it is still marginally effective, but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze.\n\nedit: u/rozhasi says \"Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the 'margin' feature from your current account, they can\u2019t lend your shares to short sellers.\"\n\nedit2: Robinhood automatically has margin enabled, so we do not want to be using RH AT ALL anymore. Users report that after transferring from RH to Fidelity the Fidelity account automatically had margin enabled (even though *new* Fidelity accounts default to margin-disabled.) *If anyone has experience (A) transferring RH shares to a non-margin account, or (B) disabling margin on an account that RH shares have been transferred into, please post in the comments and I will try and add a how-to here.*\n\nedit3: from u/A1pha101:  for all you Nords, Nordnet Investing Account Zero has share lending **on by default**, but there is a form you can fill out to disable it. I can't vet the link they sent to the form (it's in Norwegian hosted on [scrive.com](https://scrive.com)) so I'm hesitant to share it, but more info can be found here:  [https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/](https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/) .

{"title": "The Interstellar Yoyo \u2b50\ud83e\ude80\u2b50", "selftext": "Hallo all. I've been watching what's going on with great interest. There have been many things I can't explain. So I sat down and did a Think. But I know we're all just simple apes here, so why don't I tell you a bedtime story instead?\n\n**Story Time**\n\nImagine there's a GME market participant, looking for a quick buck, with not the best grip on morality. I know that's a big stretch, but just go with me. We'll call him 'Snidely'.\n\nSnidely is big into shorts, where you borrow a stock from someone, sell it immediately, and have to buy it from someone else later. But normal shorting isn't quite exciting enough for him. He wants to go naked. A naked short is when you skip that whole 'borrow' step at the beginning.\n\nSo Snidely notices that, due to [17 CFR 242.203 b 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203#b_3), he can issue a short without actually having to go through the annoyance of borrowing it, and has 13 \"settlement\" (\"business\") days to actually find someone willing to lend him that stock. This is great news for Snidely! It means that he can sell a stock he made up on the spot, then look for ideal times in the next 2-3 weeks to find someone he can borrow from to un-make it. So long as the stock price even temporarily falls below his sale price sometime in the timeframe, he can make money by borrowing at that point. He just found a freakin' cheat code for cash!\n\nAnd so Snidely issues the naked short sell, and sells off his newly minted \"stock\". He finds ample buyers, and has no problems with that bit. Shucks, he can actually sell a little under market level if he needs to - After all, he can always just print more stock. Hahaha, Snidely goes brrrrr.\n\nBut then the unthinkable happens. Some idiots actually buy the stock, and the price stays higher than he bought for the entire 13 settlement day period. FUCK. Now he HAS to borrow, or he loses access to his wonderful money printer, as per [17 CFR 242.203 b 3 iv](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203#b_3_iv).\n\nSo he does. And loses some money. It sucks. Oh, and the stock price went up, because he had to buy so much. And then some moronic internet forum notices him doing this, and starts to buy too. Fuck. FUCK. If this idiots actually manage to peg the stock at this level, he'll be out of a job. He might actually have to buy the cheap caviar, or whatever it is the poors eat.\n\nSo Snidely looks in his bag of tricks... and only sees one trick. And so he begins naked short selling stocks that he knows he doesn't have yet. He does it a little below market rate, because that helps cool the stock off, which helps him. He has 13 whole days for the stock price to drop, after all. He uses the money from the new shares to start borrowing shares to cover his old ones. Weirdly, the liquidity isn't as low as the numbers would suggest, and he's able to borrow enough to cover his position fairly easily.\n\nPlot twist - Snidely isn't the only Snidely. Snidely is legion. And as each Snidely pursues this plan, the stock price drops, since they all feel comfortable selling a little below market. And while they're covering, they *buy up each other's made up stocks*.\n\nThey haven't fixed the problem. They've just moved it 13 settlement days down the road. And made it bigger.\n\nAnd once one of them starts buying to cover their new position, the rest will panic and join in, and the stock will soar again.\n\n**Evidence**\n\nSooo... if this story is somewhat true, what events should we have already seen?\n\n* We should expect to see a slightly less than 13 settlement day period between stock increases, because if Snidely's wait too long they lose access to the ability to naked short. Given that GME first jumped in price on [Jan 12th](http://www.google.com/search?q=gme), then again on the 26th, that gives an 11 day period - Exactly in line with what we expect.\n* We should expect to see anger and push back from wall street in that same slightly-less-than-13-settlement-day period, fading rapidly as they choose to 'cover' their positions by selling more fake shares. This is more or less exactly what we saw on this subreddit.\n* Shorts should be extremely eager to tell us the closed out their positions, because they also opened new positions and NEED the stock to go back down before their time limit runs out. Yup, we sure as fuck saw that.\n* We should have seen Failure-to-deliver figures high, and growing. [Yup, that's exactly what we see in GME.](https://wherearetheshares.com/)\n* We should expect to see a sky-high official short rate that *isn't* reflected in third party data. We already see that in the existing data.\n* We should see the SEC being uninterested in the shorts/Snidely, because no actual laws were broken by this behavior. And wow would \"uninterested in the shorts\" be a motherfucking understatement for what the SEC is up to.\n\n**Anti-Evidence**\n\nSome stuff doesn't fit neatly into this theory, and needs other explanations or caveats.\n\n* Robinhood and other brokers shutting off buying is not directly explained by this. Buuuut I feel like the current explanations of increased capital requirements due to Snidely-induced volatility mostly does a fine job of explaining this.\n* We shouldn't see firms resorting to illegal tactics like ladder attacks, since they can accomplish their goals legally. But every instances of a 'ladder' attack we've seen is better explained by a Snidely bulk selling naked shorts.\n* The push for the fake 'Silver squeeze' is not explained by this. I think that was just an opportunistic play, rather than an actual distraction attempt.\n\n**Predictions**\n\n* An actual short squeeze will never happen. The Snidely's can just print more naked shorts whenever they need them.\n* We should see Failure-to-deliver figures jump when the next data dump occurs. [Watch here.](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)\n* We should see a growing official short interest that isn't reflected in third party figures.\n* *We should expect to see a massive rise in the stock price about 11-13 settlement days after the last large stock rise. Which puts the date for expected movement around Feb 10-12*\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nSorry friends, this isn't a VW-style short squeeze, infinite squeeze, or rocket to the moon. It's a fucking interstellar yoyo that's going to keep shooting up higher and higher in nearly-13 day intervals until *something* breaks.\n\nStock owners aren't the bag holders. The Snidely's are.\n\n**Dirkson, what should I doo^o^o^o ?**\n\nOh, hell if I know. I'm not a lawyer, your lawyer, a stock dude, CPA, CFA, CFP, or whatever. I'm just some idiot who thought it was a good idea to buy two shares at $300. I wasn't even one of you before the Vast Migration, and I still don't talk right.\n\nNone of this is legal or financial advice, I'm just discussing what I think is happening. Think for your own damn self!\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nNo\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15. Yes \u2b50\ud83e\ude80\u2b50.\n\n*Edit: Feel free to copy/paste this anywhere else you like, just PM/ping me when you do.

Not sure that they needed to use FTDs to bring it down though. I'm sure plenty of people were willing to sell near that top.
