{"title": "Geopolitics and semiconductors : Taiwan is leveraging TSMC/Qualcomm to force US confrontation on independence issue", "selftext": "So you\u2019ve probably heard the news of Taiwan being \u201cthanked\u201d by America for alleviating chip supplies. But there\u2019s some geopolitics behind this. \n\nThere\u2019s talk that Taiwan is essentially putting all cards on the table and push the issue of independence at all costs in a do or die effort. Essentially, Taiwan wants to pressure America into announcing full on Taiwanese independence and committing to it. This would be the culmination of the modern Taiwan issue, and essentially would be the end of the 2 Chinas status quo. \n\nThis is basically a gamble by the Taiwanese hawks (DPP) who are willing to sacrifice their reputation and market share of TSMC in order to force support.\n\nHow? \n\nBy forcing an artificial shortage of chips. This not only leads to shortage of automobile chips for Chinese companies, but also incentivizes America to give full support. Btw, EU feels betrayed on this especially since they supported a Taiwanese petition to block lithiogram machines. \n\nThe reason Taiwan is playing chicken is because they feel there is a limited opportunity to force American commitment before China grows too powerful. Likewise, US hawks also want to force a confrontation since it\u2019s \u201cnow or never\u201d before China reaches peer state status.\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Taiwan is planning an artificial shortage of chips especially for the auto sector to pressure US into independent support.\n\n- Geopoltics is prioritized over business practices, since market share could be lost and business relations strained as EU/China/Us companies feel alienated and untrusting.\n\n- DPP is using TSMC/Qualcomm for geopoltics in a last ditch effort to force Biden admin on the China issue \n\n\nWhat to do:\n\nI honestly don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m hoping other ppl here can say how money can be made off this lol.

{"title": "$PCG (PG&E) - California Utilities DD", "selftext": "**Position**: I purchased $PCG shares at $4.98/share and added to my position last week.  Also purchased $SRE and $EIX. \n\n**Summary**:\n\nCalifornia utilities are undervalued ($SRE, $EIX, $PCG) and still down \\~ 27% from pre-Covid levels.  I believe all are strong buys \u2013 I have positions across the board. $PCG is my most bullish. I believe it is a very cheap entry point for a company that has proven to be bulletproof to regulators/oversight.\n\nPGE Emerged from Bankruptcy with $25.5 B settlement\n\nPGE should be eligible to reinstate dividend in 2022. Cheap entry into a growth stock with an expected reissuance of dividend.\n\nWild fire risks are low in winter, spring and early summer. 2020 was actually a very intense fire season but CA utilities mostly came out unscathed due to public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).  \n\n1) **CA Utilities Undervalued**  \n The real BRRRR are utilities. They print their own money by capital improvement deprecation based on rate cases. Due to the 2018 wildfires and subsequent PSPS, utilities are getting authorized by California and Federal regulators to do more capitalized projects than ever. What does this mean? Revenues are going to be higher than ever. In the case of PCG, they hit the sweet spot in ineffectiveness. Doing so bad not to go bankrupt, but bad enough to get all their projects authorized by the state to maximize revenue.   Again, the California Public Utility Commission authorized the highest general rate case ever. \n\n2) **Bankruptcy Settlement**  \n $PCG\u2019s market cap is $23.54B and has an outstanding bankruptcy $25.5 B settlement as of June 2020. Why is this significant? For one, the optics of having a valuation larger than your settlement liability flip (due to a $5.4 billion and partial $1.35B obligation) with February 25th earnings (unless the stock goes down by 20%) but more importantly, the settlement was incredibly favorable to $PCG.  \n\n$PCG will likely post their highest annual revenue ever. EVER\u2014see item #1. This wouldn\u2019t work in the real world (maybe banking in 2008), but in the California utility world, if you screw up you get more money. Fire happened 2018, 2017 $PCG had $17.14B in revenue. 2020 revenue might be as high as $18.71B. So likely 10% higher revenues two years after a colossal failure.  \n\nThis is why utilities are included in the Monopoly game. \n\n3) **Dividend and Leadership**  \n $PCG agreed to freeze their dividend until $6.2B in non-GAPP core earnings. This target can be met as soon as 2022\u2014not much of a penalty all things considered especially with the cheap entry point for this stock (down 36% from pre-COVID, down 52% from post fire peak) \n\nAnother settlement term was restructuring the entire leadership team. $PCG did that, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re replacing Jason Garrett with Mike McCarthy. They got themselves someone with a proven record leading utilities in Patricia Pope, who signed a 5-year deal with PG&E starting January 4, 2021. She previously served as CEO for Consumer\u2019s Energy which was known for safety. She\u2019s also the first women to ever lead two Fortune 500 companies. This will be her first earnings call for PG&E. Her announcement caused a brief spike in the stock\u2014I expect the same with her first earning call (particularly with the positive numbers). \n\n4) **Wildfires**  \n Why buy now? Wildfire season is officially over now that CA received a ton of rain. This should be reflected in the risk for all utilities, but hasn\u2019t resolved yet. 2020 was a very long fire season that lasted deep into January 2021. With all the PSPS and redflag warnings, I was hesitant to pull the trigger until CA was in the clear. I also positioned my call options to align w/ the beginning of 2021 fire season for a higher ROI if my strike price comes in. So in the clear for wildfires + new CEO + high earnings\u2014great entry point.\n\n**Potential** **obstacles**\n\nThere are pending investigations into some 2020 wildfires. Regardless of culpability, a big chunk of this will be covered by wildfire safety fund and won\u2019t be anywhere near the 2017/2018 fires.\n\nOperation and Maintenance costs/regulatory fines. Most costs are not capitalized, but most utilities know how to work around the regulators to get everything capitalized. There\u2019s always the potential for additional fines, but they\u2019d be pretty inconsequential.\n\nBiggest obstacle: Everyone hates PG&E\u2014like hate hates them. But WSB seems to be cool with Martin Shkreli so there\u2019s that.\n\n**MOAT \u2013**   \n Ultimate Moat. They are bulletproof and there\u2019s no point of entry other than acquisition. They provide infrastructure to transport power. Battery storage, solar, wind, gas, nuke, etc. all still use the same grid to transport. With higher EV demands and increase investment in fire hardening measures revenues will continue to climb.\n\n**WHY WSB?**\n\nGet that Money! Buy the utility you hate. If you\u2019re in PG&E territory, buy the utility you hate and are obligated to pay.\n\n**EDIT:**\nThanks for all the comments/feedback.  \n\n**RE: $PCG hatred.**  \nHatred 100% valid\u2014it\u2019s not going away.  They\u2019re pretty shitty.  My point is that the system has rewarded their ineptitude by forcing public investment into their business.  Those checks have already been signed and sent out.  \nIt\u2019d be like if you were the only Uber driver in town.  You drive the car, charge your passengers, and then you get in a huge wreck because you thought brake pads didn\u2019t need to be inspected/changed.  Instead of being out of a car and in jail, the state tells your passengers to pay for your repairs and give you a 10% bonus for calling the repair shop.  Does it pay to have a well-maintained car in this situation?  No! The best position to be in in this situation is to have a super shitty car that requires 15+years of repairs collecting 10% every year until the brake pads need to be replaced again and the cycle continues.  It\u2019s a monopoly.\n\n**RE WSB u/ DD**\nu/angela_lansbury busted me.  I\u2019ve only been a user for 13 days!  Well, me and 80% of the users. \nThat said, as long as I finally have a forum\u2014I have to express my gratitude to WSB.  I had no idea a community like this existed until $GME press.  I can\u2019t tell you how much joy this group has given me and how much I\u2019ve learned.  It also got me out of bed at 6:00 every morning for the past 2 weeks.\nMy DD was tribute to this group.  I think there\u2019s a good opportunity to get in to a very institutional position (utilities) for a discount.  Utilities are rigged\u2014everyone knows that.  But what is a rather recent discovery is that their shittiness is directly proportional to forced public investment.  The worse you do the more you get.  This model works pretty well for schools, roads, etc.  The difference is that guaranteed $10 for every $100 spent that goes right into the utility\u2019s coffers.\nThis isn\u2019t a back-the-truck up YOLO for me, it\u2019s an investment I believe in.  I\u2019m long on $PCG, but I also think there\u2019s going to be upward pressure soon and wanted to share it with the group.\n\n**Edit 2**\nJust realized my comment responses were getting blocked.\n\n**Re: Erin Brokovich**\n\nIn 1995 the stock was at $30.25/share, then cratered to $20 with the $333m settlement in 1996, and then was $35/share in 1998\n\nAnother example:\nThe 2010 pipeline explosion affected share price. Pre explosion $48/ share.  Dropped briefly to $43, then back up to $48/ share three months later.\n\n**Re: new utilities for counties.**\nCCAs are not utilities.  They still need to use and pay to use PGE equipment (poles, wires).  CCAs contract generation.\n\n**Re: $4.89/share**.  Users properly ridiculed you. The stock is in fact > 52 weeks old\n\n**Re: my prediction EOY**.  Tricky with fire season, but 1q earnings 2022 guess would be $20.  Don't know why it isn't $18 today.\n\nAnother point to mention is that SRE earnings come out 1 week prior to PCG and should set recovery pace.", "id": "lf8e91", "created_utc": 1612777017.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "As a California resident and former weed grower, I gotta say, FUCK PG&E! \n\nAs a stock gambler and guy who likes easy money, I\u2019m hoping my $PCG calls pay my mortgage.", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "The fact that you hate PG&E yet still give them money, very bullish", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5320069193840027}, {"body": "FUCK PG&E\n\nALL MY HOMIES HATE PG&E", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Help wildfire victims.

The following DD is based on simple assumptions, I haven't looked at the company's financial reports in-depth or used any mathematical models to forecast future cashflows.\n\nShort-term: your hope is for GME to spike. AMC is following the stock movement of GME because both have a lot of common interest due to r/wsb. If GME sees another boost, even if for a day or a couple of hours, it can be your chance to get out. If GME doesn't spike, AMC is very unlikely to do so.\n\nLong-term: let's assume that AMC will be able to operate like it used to before Covid19. Q4 2019, AMC was sitting around 8 dollars. Q3 looked better for the company where the price sat around 10. Q1-Q2 it sat around 14. You go back to 2018 it was higher. You look at 5 years, it is a downtrend. Now let's assume the price was around 12 during 2019 and that AMC could reach those heights again in 2021 after covid is done. Realistic? The answer is no. Why? dilution. AMC had 100 million shares during the start of 2020, now it has 400 million because AMC needed to raise money. It means that the company needs 4 times the amount of revenue that they had in 2019 to achieve the same evaluation and thus the same stock price which would be around 12. That obviously won't happen because regardless of what AMC does to improve performance, it won't be able to increase its' revenue 4x.\n\nAny more factors to consider? AMC still has massive debt and will operate in an industry with ever more focus on streaming.\n\nConclusion: as far as long-term sentiment goes I actually don't think the fundementals are on the company's side. Even if we assume that the company can go back to its' previous performance pre- covid19 it should still be priced way lower because of the dilution of their stocks. If we assume a price target of 12 (2019 performance and the amount of shares), it means that with the amount of shares that exist now (400 compared to 100 in 2019), the company will only be worth 3 dollars. Simplistic look, but something to keep in mind.\n\nI think the best chance of AMC having a spike is for its' price to go up because of GameStop or because of emotional investing after covid19 is over. I can see some people buying the stock without understanding the fundementals because they think ''well, it will surely go back to 15-20 now that the pandemic is over''. As far as fundementals go, I think they are weak. Yes, the company is in a better position compared to a couple of months ago when it risked bankruptcy but it happened at the cost of substantial dilution.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "There is rumors of Netflix or Amazon buying them out eventually.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty sure that was a recycled rumor from last summer.

{"title": "Why to REALLY buy GME (Solid DD)", "selftext": "LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons). \n\nSherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. \n\nWhen Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward. \n\nFils-Aim\u00e9 the Nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. He turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. This is shown in particular with his Nintendo of America endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about Reggie so I didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago) \n\nNext up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. \n\nWe recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth. \n\nNext, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. \n\nMost recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.\n\nConservative price target: $200 by mid 2021 with little hype and absent a short squeeze\n\nTldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock. \n\nBut what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions 5200 shares GME, 52x covered calls sold exp 2/12, 50x calls bought exp 2/26, a few bucks in cash waiting for a drop if it happens. Tell if I'm wrong somewhere with sources linked please and thank you.\n\nEdit: As requested, my average cost is roughly $60 after buying back in late last week. I had original shares at an average buy in of about $30 assigned to covered calls on 1/29.

I don't see the small stores becoming e sports hubs because there is not enough space for audience, equipment and competitors. And I don't see the added value buying online from them vs Amazon (where everybody already has an account) or directly from the console stores with their incredible discounts.\n\nThey might do better long term than I expect but they are certainly not worth 50 or even 60 right now.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> I certainly get your point but I do believe that there must be a valid strategy aimed at e-commerce that they will be executing\n\nEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.\n\nI actually think the e-commerce pivot is going to ultimately harm the business. I know this sounds insane but e-commerce is entirely build around convenience. And the most convenient way to buy games online is through the launchers. Steam, GOG, Epic, playstationnetwork and whatever Xbox has. Why would I want to go through a separate storefront. And if I wanted, why wouldn't it be Amazon, which has the best infrastructure and delivery times in the business?\n\nI think the only way for stores to survive is by offering the offline experience you can only get in a store. I buy my clothing offline because I want to try it on. I buy my cellphone offline because I want to know what it feels like in my hand. I buy sports equipment offline because I want to feel the balance.\n\nIf I ran a video game business I would go hard into tactile and visual experiences. Have the top tier elite gaming controllers of all manufacturers in store for gamers to try out. Have all the game merchandise in store to make sure that they can see with their own eyes how the color of the collectible looks and what that game franchise T-Shirt feels like.

Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an **options** play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have.

{"title": "Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC", "selftext": "I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.\n\nTheir reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.\n\nTo preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout \"market manipulation\" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).\n\nThe first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:\n\nMy screenshot (02/05/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xk8hlhj30fg61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8aba006b33a4b703ca7eee7ed856f553a80dc98\n\nThe short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.\n\nRegardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on \"updating data\".\n\nI presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.\n\nHowever, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.\n\nRight, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.\n\nMy screenshot (02/06/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uildby970fg61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9284081630cd1b25087b0fe69abaa112e7eaf3\n\nAs you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).\n\nIn April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.\n\nI get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?\n\nThere was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff\n\nHere's the email he received.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s04tukbb0fg61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=812fbfea028d41767684ceef6e2c7eb65a87d5d7\n\nAgain, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.\n\nThoughts.\n\nP.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.\n\nP.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!\n\nEdit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:\n\n\"Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn\u2019t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.\n\nAre you certain the chart isn\u2019t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I\u2019ll resolve your ticket but I\u2019m still here if you reply.\"\n\nI mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say \"oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more \"accurate\" measurements to our users\". Ya know?\n\n**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**\n\n**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.\n\nHis post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**\n\nAnd for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis beautiful ape tweeted at Fintel referencing this post\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4seq03r6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24808432116a21e6764ac9d1508faab3e26cd2c3\n\nThis is their response:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft0xrjbt6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54c3cb8e783953cd2b62f069245e282e4efd86d5\n\nSo their excuse is a \"programming error\". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).\n\nI'm just sayin' feels like excuses to me.", "id": "lfcpce", "created_utc": 1612793882.0, "score": 3661, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 334, "comments": [{"body": "I asked a similar question regarding their changing data, this as the response;\n\n\"Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern!

{"title": "Enphase Energy (ENPH) pre-earnings (Feb 9) Extensive DD", "selftext": "EDIT: Posted a post-earnings DD in which I analyzed the earnings results and web-call. Post is under approval and is not online yet. Let's hope a Mod will approve it ASAP.   \nHi all,\n\nSince the GME hype has calmed down a bit, I present you with my first DD on this forum.\n\nFirst of all, no financial analyst here. This is no investment advice and do your own research.\n\nI will take you trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do.\n\n**Okay here we go:**\n\nI have a background in economics. Since the market nowadays is quite high, I am trying to analyze every investment I make thoroughly to minimize the risks. After November last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. However, we have increased a lot and I feel the urge to deep dive in every company I invest in.\n\n**Step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.**\n\nWhat my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next week\u2019s earnings. I analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.\n\nWhile doing this, me and my team have picked Enphase Energy.\n\n**Step 1, look at the previous realized EPS and Revenue vs. forecasted EPS and Revenue:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtl7ekf7t9g61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=939fb0f1be41f22db8691e0988faaba30274826c\n\nFirst observations:\n\n\\- 2020 amazing year.\n\n\\- Dip Q3 2019.\n\n\\- Good year 2018\n\n\\- Something was going on in 2017. But there was a change since 2018, 2019, 2020 are good years.\n\n\\- Bad year 2016, again something changed.\n\nPlease note the price implication in the last column. Visualized here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uuaap768t9g61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe52c18b03d49437ca465d0657c9b6581ac3e91c\n\n**Step 2: Company snapshot.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1c1s3n8t9g61.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0e4631b87c5b7a3fcba79311d0020c6efdd8733\n\nObservation: High P/E value compared to competitors.

So buying now would on average be a good idea. This month it has increased 6% while the average for February is 24.8% (8 year average) (no statistically proven).\n\n**Step 4, Ownership.**\n\n**Important question to ask: were there any strong buys/sells in the last couple months. The more recent the data, the better.

I have been in solar industry my whole adult life. Started with Tesla before they went public.\n\n\"SolarEdge happened\". New electric code came out in 2017 (2017 NEC) requiring \"arc fault protection\" within 10' of panels. Enphase micro inverters had this built in but got sukerpunched by the cheaper SolarEdge \"whole system\" inverter with individual diodes at each panel. Somehow SolarEdge designed and launched a product that somehow bypassed the new regulations right before they were implemented. Many in the industry thought this was extremely fishy and still do.\n\nOlder Enphase micro inverters (215 &250) models had some \"staying connected\" issues with home Wi-Fi systems. They also had some individual microinverters fail and need replaced. And, some installers didn't fully plug everything together resulting in customers losing production from system.\n\nThe American made Enphase were a superior product even with those small temporary issues. The newer models from 2016 on have been great and still hold distinct advantages in warranty, ability to add individual panels facing different directions, monitoring, etc,etc.\n\nThis company stayed strong when they got \"screwed\". Kept up great customer service.

Old-school \"string\" or central\" inverters are still the best solution for most wide-open, optimal facing systems. Also most ground mounted arrays should use string inverters because of distance to electrical box. \n\nSolarEdge uses these \"string\" inverters in their system and is the \"weak link\" in their design IMO.

That big tree at the corner of my property starts throwing some shade on the array, all of those panels in full sun are slacking. Enphase makes \"micro-inverters\" which allow each panel to operate independently. Their product makes the solar installation a little more expensive on a per-panel basis. In non-ideal solar areas (like where I live), though, the price per kWh produced is better -- or, more accurately, I can produce the power I need with fewer panels (less space AND less money).

{"title": "February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates", "selftext": "For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.\n\nThe size of the move depends mainly on two things:\n\n\\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.\n\n\\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.\n\nDrug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.\n\nHere's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:\n\nI have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):\n\n* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small\n* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large\n* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small\n* 28 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Libtayo (metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), addressable market: small\n* 28 Feb 21 [$BPMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BPMC) Pralsetinib (metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer), addressable market: small\n* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium\n\nMy positions:\n\nI have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX.
