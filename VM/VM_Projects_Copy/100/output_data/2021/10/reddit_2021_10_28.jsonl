Leaked reports, if true will be able to beat AMD at their respective price points. (Of course AMD can always just play price cuts. Additionally, AMD has already showed their new tech V Cache which can supposedly improve peformance by up to 15% over their existing 5k Ryzen series but those will come ETA 1st half 2022.) Intel is also going to release GPUs (which will probably be buggy since its the first time Intel is selling GPUs), but they \\*claim\\* they can fight with Nvidia's RTX 3070. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNew CEO May be good for intel. He was the ex VMWARE CEO and used to be an Intel employee before. Was mentored by Intel's founder. He tripled VMWare's revenue while he was their CEO from 2012-2021. Intel is also investing heavily into R&D and making new foundries, which is in line with USA's national interest in not being overly reliant on an endangered Taiwan SMC in case China takes over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportantly, Intel just failed their Q3 earnings HORRIBLY (AS EXPECTED from SHITEL) and cut guidance. Their stock crashed from $56 last week to $48 today. The stock is partially beat down (though imo, i think it still could bleed out further. Will pick up more INTC if it drops more.) Expectations for this company has been reduced due to their poor performance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy buy these calls instead of the stock? Because there is almost no theta for these calls. $30 strike + $18.15 = $48.15 for a 2023 LEAP. And $40+$8.05 = $48.05 for a 3mths call. Stock is at $48.05 at time of posting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a half decent chance that Intel can do a partial AMD. AMD was a loser that made inferior cpus for 10 years. Intel has been a loser for 2 years. Even being competitive with AMD is an upgrade from being a loser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Intel has positive catalysts in new, competitive CPUs launching on Nov 4.

Also on Thursday, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said that to his knowledge, Lucid and Tesla are the \"only two EV companies in the world today\" that design, develop and make their own electric vehicles, from battery packs to motors, inverters, software and even the transmission. Rawlinson made those comments at FII 5, an event held in Riyadh by a Saudi Arabian sustainability nonprofit, a YouTube video shows. He also presented a slide showing that Lucid EVs are the top six longest-range, EPA-rated electric vehicles in the U.S. \"Lucid holds the crown for range,\" he said.\n\nA day earlier, Lucid Motors (LCID) announced the first deliveries to customers of the Dream launch edition of its Air electric sedan will begin Oct. 30. The Lucid Air \"is the world's first 500-mile electric vehicle,\" built with proprietary EV technology, the release said. The company will hold a delivery event in California Oct. 30, which will be streamed on various social media channels.\n\n[https://www.investors.com/news/lucid-pops-tesla-beating-air-ev-hits-road-oct-30/](https://www.investors.com/news/lucid-pops-tesla-beating-air-ev-hits-road-oct-30/)", "id": "qhrlmd", "created_utc": 1635440799.0, "score": 406, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 228, "comments": [{"body": "I almost exited my call options yesterday but thought I'll wait & see what comes out of the social-spending package..and boy, I'm glad I held on", "score": 159, "replies": [{"body": "Well done sir!!", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37864378094673157}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15203188359737396}, {"body": "Why would you consider exiting lucid when tesla has gone on such a massive run.

AWS being the 1st out the gate with reliable cloud really matters. So many companies are entrenched in theirs that its very hard to move over and simply not worth the cost. We are going through this right now at my work.

Salesforce is a different story entirely in that regard and their moat is Huge because you can\u2019t escape that platform.\n\nGoogle cloud will probably have the best interface and will be the winner in terms of usability and features but the windows enterprise ecosystem is Microsoft\u2019s bread and butter. As a cheap bastard I find all of them expensive but wealth buys what they already know and flock to it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There is no common tie between consumer use and cloud. Thus the familiarity argument doesnt apply at the consumer level. Cloud is exclusively a enterprise tool. Applications run on cloud, but cloud is not the application. You can just as easily run any MSFT cloud application on any of the cloud providers. It would perform better on GC and AWS especially internationally.\n\nSo the only familiarity we need to consider is enterprise. The problem with enterprise is professionals arent as limited as end users. So you ask a dev or admin which cloud to use and they will tell you that it will depend on what kind of functionality do you need, what performance you want, what kind of support, and finally how much you are willing to pay. Based on those, they will select a provider but none of the questions will be what phone or OS you run or what do you run in your local server room because it doesnt matter.\n\nAlso note that MSFT is actually not the internet server leader. In fact I seriously doubt their cloud runs windows. They never were internet server leaders because windows to this day, is still not very reliable for server use. Unix won that fight by a huge margin long ago. I know MSFT has made strides but trust me, its still not even close. We moved from Windows Servers 2016 to GC last year (Debian boxes) and guess what? We went from servers requiring regular maintenance every other week (because ultimately memory problems cause instance crashes) to literally not a single crash since last year.... NOT ONE. Nothing changed with the core server code and we still run some old windows servers so we know its not the code. Its just windows... its memory management design is just not reliable for server use.\n\nSo in terms enterprise internet servers MSFT is actually not the familiar face at all. But again, MSFT has their strengths which is why I still like them. MSFT strength is LAN management servers (not internet/WAN). They own that space.

Now, not sure if that is just from increased efficiency in the battery or also from being able to deplete it further (i.e. in theory a capacity increase), but seems with the 4680's Tesla's batteries will match of exceed the efficiency of Lucid's battery, with no clear way to improve on efficiency (tabless cells should be near 100% efficiency).\n\nThinking about it this way, makes sense how Lucid did what they did. It also strongly indicates that their batteries are expensive, as adding those extra tabs is not going to be an efficient process, like the 4680's.\n\nJust some food for thought here. If I am right, it helps explain why Lucid's cheaper models (the upcoming Touring and Pure) are not price-competitive and don't have better specs than a Model S LR. Simply put, the batteries Lucid is using is too expensive. 118 kWh's at $150 per kWh (making up numbers here) is $17.7K for a battery pack. On the other hand a 100 kWh pack (more efficient and gives lots of weight reductions so Tesla will actually get competitive range with less kWh's) at $75 per kWh is only $7.5K.\n\nFurther, if I am right, then bottom line being the best at manufacturing will be what sets Tesla apart. Lucid, will struggle with an overly expensive cost of manufacturing, which will prevent them from scaling or actually competing with Tesla in a meaningful way.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I doubt it's something like that, is not just the adding more tabs, while that would help, that would only be at peaks of power, and this is not what we have at EPA testing\n\nI never looked much at them, but the specs seem confusing, for example, they give a consumption of 250 Wh/mi on the charging rate spec, if we assume that this is for EPA highway, this means the pack is actually 130 kWh, unless that is from the wall, but that makes no sense to quote like that\n\nWe also have exploded view with 4 modules removed, that could mean that those packs have around 105 kWh for 406 mi range, a little bit less efficient than the Model S 2021 LR\n\nCharging we will need to see, but are safe (ish) to assume that the new Model S and X can support a peak of 300 kW in a 100 kWh pack, so 300 kW on a 130 kWh pack is amazing but not as much, if it also supports 300 kW on the 406 mi variant, which I doubt since they explicitly say that 900 V architecture is just for some versions, it will be good", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "EPA tests by depleting the battery and then charging, measuring the amount of charge the batteries take (in kWh's) and then doing their driving test till the car is depleted. They don't go by the spec on the battery.\n\nSo in simple the EPA is measuring input kWh's and output miles. So if Lucid is getting more range it almost certainly means they are more efficient. I don't think there is any doubt that battery efficiency is not perfect, so if you can improve that you can get more output miles per kWh. The 4680's with tabless have 5X the capacity and 6X the power and get 16% more range. That tells you, reducing electrical resistance improves battery efficiency. Hence, I suspect Lucid is using customized and expensive cells with extra tabs attached in order to achieve greater efficiency. Could be I am wrong, so would really like to see a teardown.
