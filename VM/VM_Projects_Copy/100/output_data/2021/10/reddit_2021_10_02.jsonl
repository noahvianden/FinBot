Obviously range would be better if battery density can be improved. But where a lot of the real challenges lie is in building out the network. You need a network of landing spots in urban environments and thus there are network effects, you need to recondition society to adopt this new mode of transport into their everyday lives, you need to solve the first/last mile problems, etc. Tesla might have some advantages here soon. Perhaps supercharger locations could be landing sites. Perhaps first/last mile can be solved by autonomous Tesla\u2019s. That said, I think if Tesla gets true autonomy working then VTOL is less valuable as a business. If you can be productive in your car doing something else when it\u2019s driving you, does it matter if it takes you 2x-3x longer to get somewhere?

It's that they know how to do what they've always done, but that's not going to cut it anymore. They are really behind in the two biggest areas with EVs, batteries and software. And, they have to deal with so many things that an EV-only company doesn't, like sharing profit with dealers, cannibalizing ICE sales while trying to grow EV sales, and figuring out how to profitably convert legacy factories and legacy workers to the new technology. Also, they have to spend billions on advertising and Tesla doesn't spend a cent.\n\n>none thought about using casting machines to eliminate 1/3 of the assembly process?\n\nSandy Munroe talks extensively about why they haven't and won't follow Tesla's lead with the casting machines. One of the main reasons is that these are so expensive that they only make sense financially when you are planning to make millions of the same car model. Look at how many different car models GM has, for example. Then look at Tesla with only 4 models, and currently only one (model Y) is using the mega casting machines. \n\nAnother reason is that it's not easy to get the casting machines to work for this purpose. Tesla had to invent an entirely new material for this. Not saying nobody else can do it, but that will be a huge challenge if they try.\n\n>And now, people tell me that only Tesla know how to build cars? I just don't believe it\n\nNo, I'm not actually hearing that from anyone.
