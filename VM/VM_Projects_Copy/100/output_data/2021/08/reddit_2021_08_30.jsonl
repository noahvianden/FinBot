{"title": "The markets not going to crash", "selftext": "Let me just ask anyone who thinks that there's an immanent crash incoming.... if the market were to crash tomorrow, and apple were to suddenly cost 70 dollars a share.... what would you do?\n\nWould you:\n\na) cry and throw your phone in the ocean\n\nb) quit trading forever and kick your wife's boyfriend out of the house\n\nor c) sell your car, sell your house and live in a cardboard box, empty your kid's college fund, get a 2nd job, heck, a 3rd job as a stripper in wall street where you will dance for analysts at Melvin capital, and put every single dollar you could possibly get your hands on into apple?\n\nI would say 90%, and that's a conservative estimate, of people who are into stocks would choose option C. I think even Warren Buffet would move into a cardboard box next door to you and explain that sold everything he has for apple shares if it \"crashed\" by 40% or more right now.\n\nWhich brings me to my point. For those massive companies with inflated market caps to crash, there has to be some kind of Earth shattering event that would make even the diamondiest of hands afraid to touch them. Not \"hey man, apple is making me too much money, think I'm gonna sell it for some bonds instead\". I'm talking a pandemic that shuts down the whole world's economy, several gigantic banks going out of business, fucking meteors falling out of the sky, Yellowstone erupting, that's what has to happen for people to start selling their blue chipped shares and for the market to crash. It will happen from time to time, but it can't be predicted by number crunching on a chart. It has to be something concrete.\n\nLike in 2008, the market's didn't just crash randomly, they kept rebounding back and forth until finally it became obvious to everyone that the economy was going to be pretty much destroyed by several banks collapsing. So maybe, someone could have been smart enough in early 2008 to see the potential damage those banks were going to cause by going under, decide that congress was going to be too indecisive to do anything about it, and get out before the crash. But that was the result of an event that was happening, it had nothing to do with p/e's and derivatives and chart pattern. Stocks didn't crash in 2008 because they were \"overvalued\".\n\nTL:DR: Unless someone has a very specific reason to be afraid of a crash, not \"the fed is printing too much money\" or \"p/e's are too high\", they are totally full of it.", "id": "peo1k7", "created_utc": 1630348169.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|194|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "my small uninformed opinion - the enormous infusion on unemployment money to the masses who want nothing more than to spend it on new phones, new laptops and new cars is what's driving these earnings numbers.

Seems unlikely since to date nothing has changed in their approach. So until the macro economics determine a change in approach is needed or they decide to change approach for another reason I have no reason to assume their ability to sniff out the future has deteriorated. \n\nBasically if you can\u2019t handle the ups/downs of a volatile market then you have no business investing in a speculative sector/s. Ark funds focus on disruption and innovation. By definition companies in that category are unproven or on the cusp of true innovation resulting in lots of failed investments in companies that never pan out. There are going to be mistakes, drawdowns, frauds, etc. the goal is to be early enough on some of these that the upside overshadows the downside. I.e Tesla, zoom, Roku, crisper, SQ, Illumina, etc. \n\nAnyways this isn\u2019t an argument for anyone to invest in ARK today. Valuations are still crazy high and more downside is likely ahead. This is an argument against those claiming that this years draws downs are any different than years past. That somehow all of a sudden now she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing even though she has an incredible success record.

He thinks the fed can't ignore inflation and taper and rates have to rise and it will hurt companies with high valuations the most. You've pointed out in your post that the nature of the companies she buys tends to have high valuations. In order for bonds to rise the fed has to let go of tapering and has to probably raise rates themselves also. If you don't understand exactly how the fed reserve rate functions and how it's not quite the same as setting the interest rate on treasury bonds but definitely does affect interest rates then I recommend learning about it. It is a bit nuanced but useful. Understanding exactly how the tools the fed has work is really important in today's market is my point. \n\nBased on that here's my opinion \n\n\nMichael burry fanboys just don't realize. When the dude actually IS right he's years goddamn early. You seriously miscalculate the level of irresponsibility that government officials can maintain when they don't want to either lose their position or get their cheeks clapped by the public. \n\nThe old saying used to be the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent\n\nThe current version is Jpow and the Biden administration\n\n- (who CANNOT handle a market downturn when he's dealing with the biggest foreign policy mistake in US in 100 years plus COVID delta surge plus inflation talk already scaring middle America while his left wing base demands trillions in new bills of spending or else he's the old white man traitor to the cause)-\n \nor just the government in general can remain drastically irresponsible and self serving way longer than you can remain solvent \n\n(especially if you start as early as Michael burry does with a thesis.)\n\nYou don't get that they've built everything on these negative bond yields and if you think they're going to do the responsible thing when it involves them also guaranteeing a ravenously angry public after a market crash directly due to the CHOICES and action of the government then I think you're a bit naive. \n\nRead the book burry himself cited at the beginning of all this shit. Dying of money. There's a free pdf. \n\nIt literally details how the government always goes too far with this shit and yet burry himself is betting that they just call it quits in the first inning?? The dude understands macro economics and data on trends that involves all of history and is great at looking at data but it's extremely clear he doesn't understand people at all. He literally was surprised when his bosses were furious at him for essentially yoloing a multi billion dollar fund on something that had never happened before (which he didn't exactly predict he found evidence of systemic fraud which allowed him to predict would eventually come out thus making the MBSs worthless) like yea great play but he actually didn't understand why they were mad at him. If his timing had been too off or if anything had occurred outside of his framework he essentially would've lost the entire fund on one play and the fact that he didn't get that they would be angry at him when he claims he's all about preserving wealth proves he doesn't understand people for shit. Let's also consider that he literally talks about how he doesn't understand people at all.\n\n\nHis own research should tell him his play is too early. If you read his book he loves so much you'd be like yea the reason we're fucked is because the likelihood that the government behaves irresponsibly for too long is ridiculously high. \n\nThis is the man who discovered the extreme corruption and fraud that caused 08 and then watched the government PAY THE BILL for the corruption and fraud the government that then INVESTIGATED AND AUDITED BURRY MANY TIMES WHILE NOT PROSECUTING ANYONE WHO BLATANTLY DEFRAUDED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY and then inflated away the bill that they used to save the country for that disaster. And this man thinks that government who has not changed the tiniest bit is going to behave responsibly. \n\nYou guys gotta think broader. There's times when you play the odds of the hand and there's times when you play the man you're against in poker. This one isn't about understanding the data. It's about playing the men involved\n\n\nSo. Is cathie wood a good stock picker? I don't really care and I don't think Burry actually does either. He just thinks if he's right about inflation it will mean he's right about the fed meaning he's right about bonds means  hes right that her fund will suffer more than most in the market as a direct result. He thinks that it's the best way to get exposure for his theory. He's just doubling down without getting in quite the \"yolo\" territory as he did in 08.

Which would've been true in the past especially a very long time ago. \n\nBut now it's a different paradigm and I think there's a strong chance he's mostly wrong about what the fed will or will not do especially for another 6 months.

If there is major underlying rot like in commercial real estate or some kind of truly harmful event during this time we could see things much worse because the fed can't adjust its course until inflation has gone down. So we could easily go much lower in any sector. \n\nMid terms will be interesting assuming they play out like everyone predicts they will.

WoW's been in a downward spiral for years, but they still have a dedicated fan base that just can't seem to let go of the game.

Elon's engineers convinced him to take a less ambitious approach with the Model Y.\n\nThe main issue I think with moving to a 50-60v architecture is that Tesla currently uses parts made for ICE vehicles, i.e. one example is the brake system made by Bosch. All of these parts use a 12v architecture. Tesla would need to replace all the external supplier parts with 60v ones (that don't exist). Their internal parts can be moved over more easily, but the external ones probably require massive orders before it makes sense for the supplier to invest in the R&D required.\n\nThere is also the CAN bus data system that needs to be updated. In the end, the car should be similar to your home network, with each part in the car connected to the 'network' and sending packets between devices for communication. There is also the possibility for 'wireless' vehicles where radio waves are used to transmit signals within the vehicles rather than cable, but this can be added in later.\n\nAs you can see the CAN and 12v architectures are kind of wedded together. Tesla can't just buy an off the shelf Bosch part and plug it into their ethernet 50-60v architecture. Tesla will need to use redesigned parts whose electronics have been redone to fit the new paradigm.\n\nOnce Tesla has the Berlin/Texas Phase 1's and Fremont/Shanghai fully ramped, Tesla will be making 2-3 million vehicles a year. At this point, I think Tesla could agree to a supply contract with Bosch or whoever make the 12v parts to make a 60v part. I think Tesla is also better placed than Legacy auto to move to this 'next gen' wire architecture because they make more parts in-house. Maybe Tesla also could co-engineer the part with them and take a small licensing fee.\n\nIt would be interesting to see how many electronically controlled parts exist in a Tesla that are off the shelf components.
