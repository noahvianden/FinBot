And in fact, Hyperloop One plans on being underground. Creating a tolerance for non-adiabatic expansion isn\u2019t that complicated. Musk is aware that you need to account for thermal expansion at the pylons as well as the terminals. It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t numerous different methods that can be done to deal with expansion or increased curvature in various directions. The sun causing an affect on the tube could be dealt with very simply. You don\u2019t need the actual tunnel to be exposed directly to sunlight. Beyond that, you\u2019re mentioning pressure, another common argument, which is 10,000 kg per square meter. If you are really so worried about this, you can actually layer their outside with air gaps in between, these gaps are at a higher pressure than inside but still less than atmospheric. Using this method, you could drop the pressure on the inside tube to anything you like really, because you are mediating that pressure on other surfaces. Pressure is really the least of the issues when it comes to what\u2019s technologically possible. Building below ground is great for places absent of earthquakes. The temperatures are more stable, there\u2019s no wind or rain to worry about. Obviously no tornadoes or lightning.\n\nIn my opinion, the bigger issues are with the actual transportation pod and not at all with the structure. With how fast the turbo pump is spinning, there is going to be a lot of centrifugal forces on the prop. Plus you have to deal with the turbulence from the air inside the tube. I think you should focus your criticisms there and not the pipe and you have an argument.
