{"title": "I sold 217.5 HD put and got 215 put as protection (-217.5p/+215p). HD closes at 217.47 at expiration 8/23 and I incurred max loss.", "selftext": "I sold 300 of the -217.5p/+215p credit spread for HD with 8/23 expiration.  The max loss should be $2.50.  At the closing on Friday, HD closed at $217.47 so those put contract I sold was in the money by 0.03 cents.  However, my brokerage, bank of america, makes me take max loss of $2.50 each despite having a 0.03 cents ITM contract.\n\n1. My brokerage after hours excercised all 300 of my 215 put contracts that I bought for protection and sold all the shares at $215\n2. Today when I woke up, I found out that 198 contracts out of the 300 \"217.5 put\" contracts I sold were assigned.\n3. My brokerage could have just waited for me to be assigned and force me to sell the shares once I get assigned, but instead choose to make me take a max loss for their own protection.\n4. They also said they have a team to close any in the money contracts 1 hour before the market closes. However, my 217.50 put were not on their radar and they missed closing my contracts before market closes.\n\nDo any of you ever had this happened?  I don't know what to do.\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I found out today 8/24 that I was assigned 19,800 shares of HD at 217.50](https://i.redd.it/e6nrepex3fi31.jpg)\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Yesterday, after hours, my brokerage decided to excercise my 215 put as protection and sold all the shares](https://i.redd.it/uzk6bl934fi31.jpg)\n\nUPDATE 1: Added the 4th point for clarification\n\nUPDATE 2 8/26/19: So the 10,200 shares of HD which was shorted at $215, I had to rebuy at $217.57.  Everything with this trade is made against the best interest of the trader.  Had Merill Edge let my sold put be assigned at $217.50, I could have sold those shares back to the market at $218 today and come out ahead.  The intervention by the human factor lead me to more than a max loss in this case.  The picture is posted below\n\nNOTE: The argument that my account cannot handle $6.5 million in HD shares is true.  However, the broker makes me takes a $6.5 million margin to buy 30,000 shares of HD whereas I was only assigned 19,800 shares at $217.50, which is roughly $4 million something.  So by forcing me to take $6.5 million, it is even riskier than just letting me be assigned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Record of trade.  They could have left my position alone.  I would have been assigned 19,800 shares of HD at $217.50 and be able to sell it back for the same price or more.

But let's assume 40K per year for now.  I have no doubt they'll sell those 40K relatively easily, but I don't think they'll be getting a lot of Tesla customers.  I mean sure, there's going to be a group of malcontent Tesla Model S/X owners that will be interested in it, but I really doubt that entire group is larger than 10K people.  Once (and if, because the Taycan will be more expensive as you start adding a few options) those people switch, you're looking at convincing ICE driving customers.  \n\nAnd that's great, every EV on the road is a win in my book, no matter who made/sold it!  But as you said, I think the Taycan is going to be popular with a richer demographic.  And of that demographic, it'll be the subset that is interested in something different, but specifically doesn't want to go with Tesla (because they've heard bad things, because they don't trust a young american car maker, or some other reason). \n\nI agree with many of the things you've said in this comment, and some of your responses below, especially regarding the different needs/wants of the potential Taycan buyers.  Another reason why I don't think they'll steal a lot of Tesla customers.  Obviously, I have no numbers to back this up, but I really think the majority of S/X buyers use that car as their primary car.  In that case, range and efficiency really does matter.  The average Taycan driver won't care as much because the car is either going to be used for daily commuting to work (I'm basing this on the absurd number of Porsche's I see heading in and out of Brussels on a daily basis), or as a weekend car like you said.  Range and efficiency matter far less.  Even fast-charging matters less because they'll just charge at home (you can be pretty sure those owners all have nice garages or at least their own driveway).\n\nSo... I think the Taycan is mostly going to be sold to existing Porsche customers, and 40-50 year olds who have money to blow and are looking for a new status symbol.  A relatively rare, new and exclusive car like the Taycan fits the bill.  A Model S, which _looks_ the same as an older Model S, doesn't.

I get the criticism that you can't be vocal about negative Tesla experiences on /r/teslamotors or TMC because you get downvoted into oblivion.  But you'd think these people would find a place where they can safely express their opinion.

Warren, for example, is indeed anti-China for humanitarian reasons, but she would definitely use trade as her primary tool to affect change in China, or worse, she would force US companies to stop supporting them via harsh economic policies. Further, any Democrat who wins would have many more tools because Dems would likely also win control of the Senate and retain control of the House. They could literally pass legislation along the lines of TPP goals (which Biden often circlejerked hard during Obama's presidency). Some of those TPP goals include 1) not allowing any trade with countries that engage in economic espionage, 2) not trading with any organization that sells any product with any stolen IP (i.e. every significant company in China), 3) no person of any country that does not allow foreigners to operate businesses and own property in their country can operate a business or own property in the US. Right now, Trump can \"order US companies out of China\" but he has no way to enforce that; he is completely impotent because the Dems control the House. But, Democrats could enact any or all of the goals stated above via legislation. They could easily force a Chinese recession. Imo, if Biden, Warren, or Booker win the primaries, China would be better off dealing with Trump rather than tanking his campaign. Also, Bernie is more of a wild card than you think.

Of course U.S. corporate-owned media outlets failed to report such consequential news to avoid upsetting their primary stockholders (i.e. hedge funds, mutual funds and other institutional investors). This law will allow U.S. firms to break into China and obtain private investment. It takes effect January 1st, 2020 and the industries allowed to operate in the country will happen in tranches. The main beneficiaries will be green energy, biotechnology and financial services.\n\n(2) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-volcker-idUSKCN1VA1B8](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-volcker-idUSKCN1VA1B8)\n\n* The 'new' Volker Rule was recently passed in unilateral fashion at the behest of the OCC & FDIC. The new rule removes certain limitations on bank-ran proprietary trading in addition to loosening risk-management policies on leveraged trading; it also opens up banks ability to invest i various forms of private equity vehicles and hedge funds. Coincidentally, this new rule will kick in -- you guessed it -- January 1st, 2020.\n\n(3) [https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/)\n\n* The Trump Tax laws were implemented before the trade war theatrics kicked into high gear. Despite being billed as some major victory for middle & low class workers, most have come to see it for what it truly is -- a corporate tax cut. The 21% corporate rate alongside a number of foreign earnings provisions were clearly designed to subsidize U.S. businesses during the tariff fire-fight, and to beef up domestic firms in anticipation of a foreign investment boom.\n\nIn essence, this whole \"trade war\" is at worst just a bunch of theatrics to keep investors off-sides while the big money builds positions in the leaders of an oncoming bull market. More likely, it is a planned attempt to strong arm the Chinese into implementing more favorable U.S.-centric provisions to the already-passed investment law.
