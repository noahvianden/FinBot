The pilots of JT610 had enough time to get their bearings and request a block altitude from ATC before MCAS finally did them in. JT610 was in the air for 7 minutes longer.\n\n>A part of what MCAS does is increase hydraulic pressure in the system that manipulates the elevator to four times normal system actuation pressure and decreases the effectiveness of rudder input using the yaw damper. Combine this increase in pressure with the stick pusher being activated and MCAS trimming the aircraft down, it is easy to see how an inexperienced crew might find themselves in an uncontrollable dive, with the resultant overspeed resulting in airframe damage that might have been able to cause a fire.\n\nDo you even know what you're talking about? \n\nFirst off, the 737-MAX is a fly-by-wire system - an \"increase in hydraulic pressure\" (which wouldn't even affect the effort needed for a pilot to change input and wouldn't even affect the manipulation of the aircraft control surfaces) wouldn't be noticeable to the pilot. Second of all, MCAS literally only controls the horizontal stabilizer trim - it doesn't even have a stick pusher. MCAS functions very similarly - almost exactly the same, even - as the Speed Trim System (STS), which would trim the nose down when CG is aft of normal during high-thrust procedures in order to reduce stab trim runaway and crash. It's very likely that pilots used to the STS system assumed that moving the yoke would shut down auto stab trim - something that MCAS overrides.\n\n>I would also remind you that the crash site is quite small, less than 500M between furthest known debris objects. This is consistent with an aircraft impacting the ground at high speed and a very high angle, and aircraft which was attempting to land in a field would leave a debris field several thousand feet long and wouldn't leave a giant hole in the ground.\n\nI would also like to remind you that the Atlas 767 that crashed a few weeks ago also impacted the ground at high speed and a very high angle... because unfortunately that's generally how fatal plane crashes happen.

In fluid mechanics terms - as your angle of attack increases (angle between airfoil and upstream velocity) - your lift force increases until a certain point where that lift force disappears completely (stall). I was expecting some other issue with the airplane but this is SOOO fundamental that it's scary to think about it. A bad analogy in a car would be your cylinder heads blow off due to too much pressure. \n\nOP can correct me if I'm wrong - but recovering from a stall on a commercial airliner at low altitude? lol no way in hell, you're definitely going to hit the ground first. Those planes have pretty flexible airframes so I imagine recovering from cruising altitude could be possible?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second thing is a system to prevent something needs to be designed \\*robustly\\* esp something as critical as stall. I.E. there really should be multiple ways of checking/double checking that the system is giving correct values and is working ok. Cockpits are complicated and the last thing you need in any troubleshooting situation is try to think of weird scenarios where something could be the issue. It has to be reflexive at that point esp with such a critical system.

When the plane hits the ground nose first - that's almost 100% due to stall and he's probably 100% correct in saying it's the stall prevention system.   \n\n\nThe news doesn't sound scary - but the actual details of it is absolutely insane.
