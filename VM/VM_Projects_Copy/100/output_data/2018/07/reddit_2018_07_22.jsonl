In fact if you can afford it, add to your portfolio at a major discount when everything tanks. Market indexes always reach new highs consistently after a crash or just in general.

Apple could easily be toppled in the same way as Microsoft. Only Google's services and Amazon seem safe to me. And Google is riskier except it's so well-established as a search engine and their ad services have monopolies. YouTube, too.

Amazon feels completely safe because I trust Bezos' baron attitude and they seem to be expanding into a lot of markets. 90% of Apple's sales revenue derive from what, two products?
