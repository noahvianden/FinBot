Now you have 8,400 in your portfolio, and your percents are now 76% stocks and 24% cash. However the cash **value** was unaffected. Now you can deploy your 20% cash to the stocks that cut their value.

When they recover, I sell them and move back into SPY to keep the 80-20 balance. Basically I expect my underlying stocks to move downward more than the SPY index, so I use the overall movement of SPY (-.4%) to buy a company that is down 4%. When it recovers that 4%, I sell it and buy SPY again. SPY may have swung 1% in that time, but my individual stock swung 4% and I net a profit for myself.\n\nIf you are more conservative or believe a bad market day is coming, I'd say do 60-40 or even 40-60, depending on how you want to insulate yourself from the market.\n\nEdit: also of note, you can reap those sweet sweet SPY dividends if you're crafty.

As the retirement date gets closer they change the distribution to be weighted towards more cash and less stocks ie risk. These portfolios are often rebalanced every 6 months to maintain the desired volatility. Ie 50 years out they are 90/10 stocks cash, 40 years out they are 70/30, 10 years out 30/70 or so.\n\n**to be clear,  I am not suggesting anyone do what I am with SPY.
