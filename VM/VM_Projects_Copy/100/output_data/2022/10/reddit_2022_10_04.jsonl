A year ago, the number of adults who felt stretched too thin was closer to 55%.\n\nEven high-income earners are feeling the strain, the report found. Of those earning more than six figures, 45% reported living paycheck to paycheck, a jump from the previous year\u2019s 38%. \n\n\u201cMore consumers living paycheck to paycheck indicates that many are continuing to lose their financial stability,\u201d said Anuj Nayar, LendingClub\u2019s financial health officer.\n\nThe consumer price index, which measures the average change in prices for consumer goods and services, rose a higher-than-expected 8.3% in August, driven by increases in food, shelter and medical care costs.\n\nAlthough real average hourly earnings also rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month, they remained down 2.8% from a year ago, which means those paychecks don\u2019t stretch as far as they used to.\n\nA separate report by Bank of America found that 71% of workers feel their pay isn\u2019t keeping up with the cost of living, bringing the number of people who feel financially secure to a five-year low.\n\nMany Americans are dipping into their cash reserves, and nearly half are falling deeper in debt.\n\nThose struggling to afford their day-to-day lifestyle tend to rely more on credit cards and carry a higher monthly balance, making them financially vulnerable, according to Nayar.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that prices have been increasing for everyday Americans \u2014 not only in the goods and services they purchase but also in the interest rates they\u2019re paying to fund their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can have detrimental consequences for someone who pays the minimum amount on their credit cards every month.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve hiked its target federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points for the third time in a row to calm runaway inflation.\n\nThe central bank has indicated even more increases are coming until inflation shows clear signs of a pullback.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/stubborn-inflation-forces-more-americans-to-live-paycheck-to-paycheck-.html\n\nIt seems consumer spending will really be getting halted sooner rather than later.

{"title": "You need to know what's going on in China.", "selftext": "# Because it's genuinely interesting.\n\nI asked a couple days ago in a thread if anyone would like to hear a brief analysis of [what\u2019s happening with the competition in the Chinese market right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/xr5unp/comment/iqdjjak/?context=3), and I got mostly positive responses, so here it is. Buckle up.\n\nFirst, I need to establish what this post isn\u2019t: I am not an investor in any company listed here. I am not taking a bull or bear position within the context of this post. I run r/chinacars for fun, and read up on what\u2019s happening in the auto industry there every day \u2014 usually with my morning coffee \u2014 to understand how the market is changing over there, and I\u2019m only sharing what I\u2019ve learned for those interested in this part of the equation.\n\nI am sure you\u2019ve also seen the kind of \u201cchicken little\u201d dynamic that goes on every time Chinese cars are mentioned on Reddit. A lot of eager Nio/Xpeng speculators going around saying things like \u201cThe Chinese companies are going to cream the west any minute now!\u201d, and a lot of equally dismissive replies. I\u2019m not attempting to further either narrative here (the truth is more complex, imo) or make a statement the potential of these companies in the European or North American markets.\n\nIn *China*, however, there is something special happening. We\u2019re at a definite inflection point, and there\u2019s been a shift.\n\n# What\u2019s happening that is different?\n\nYou may have heard that China sells a lot of EV's, and that's true, but until now, the number of local models which could credibly be called direct \u201cTesla competitors\u201d (particularly in counterpart to the 3/Y) was a very short list, effectively countable on one hand. Most of the larger state-owned players ([Changan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changan_Automobile), [SAIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor)) have been focusing on smaller cars like the BenBen EV and Wuling Mini, and most of the smaller startups have been focused on higher-end low-volume cars more akin to the Model S and Model X (Li One, Nio ES8, Nio ET7).\n\n[Beep Beep](https://preview.redd.it/ipeingqlhtr91.jpg?width=1916&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8aa53225ae18b2172b273c6df6ee7a5deb12f13)\n\nHowever... this quarter has been the craziest flood of product launches aimed right at the heart of the 3/Y demographic that I\u2019ve ever seen in the industry. Other China watchers have been saying the same thing, too. It has been a remarkable change, and for those of us watching, jaw-dropping in the force and ferocity of the announcements.\n\n# How crazy is it?\n\nHere, let me give you some perspective: About a year ago, the number of launched products that could *credibly* be called direct 3/Y competitors looked roughly like this:\n\n* Nio ES6/EC6\n* BYD Han\n* BYD Tang\n\nNote that by *credible* and *direct* I mean products in *roughly* the same category, from reputable brands, with a focus on connectivity and semi-premium market positioning \u2014 any product that could *conceivably* take a sale away from the 3/Y.\n\nIn the past year, these additions have started production:\n\n* Xpeng P5\n* Zeekr 001\n* Roewe Marvel R\n* GAC Aion S Plus\n* GAC Aion LX Plus\n* BYD Yuan Plus\n* BYD Song Plus\n\nIn the last *three months* alone, the following have now launched:\n\n* BYD Seal\n* Nio ET5\n* Nio ES7\n* Xpeng G9\n* Li L9\n* Li L8\n* Changan Shenlan 03\n* Changan Avatr 011\n* SAIC Rising R7\n* SAIC IM L7\n* Leap Motor C01\n* Hozon Neta S\n* Aito M5 EV\n\nAs you can see it's uh... significant. We've gone from a small handful of contenders to many times that amount in the span of a year, with more on the way.\n\n# Okay, but are they really any good? These are just a bunch of copycat designs, right?\n\nThe maturity and product fit of these products \u2014\u00a0particularly the group that has launched in the last three months \u2014\u00a0is consistently and remarkably better than anything we've seen before. On the powertrain side, most of these vehicles are on new platforms with modern packs, like CATL\u2019s Qilin, BYD\u2019s e-platform 3.0, or Leapmotor\u2019s CTC 3.0. They\u2019re delivering significant increases in power delivery, charging speeds, and range. Battery giant and Tesla supplier CATL has even gotten directly into the game themselves, co-developing two models \u2014 the Shenlan 03 and Avatr 011 with partner Changan.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the powertrain but also the interior work that is notable, particularly the tech. All of these cars are connected vehicles with phone apps, cellular connectivity, and some level of capability to receive over-the-air updates. Huawei\u2019s taken a particularly big leap into the industry, with their HarmonyOS infotainment system showing up on a number of vehicles, including [their own Aito M5 EV](https://youtu.be/WHyPkhlSWCM?t=239). This is a step-change in sophistication for most automakers, offering a fluid experience, app support, and much more intuitive design than before \u2014\u00a0all similar to what Tesla offers.\n\n[Huawei HarmonyOS IVI on the Avatr 011](https://preview.redd.it/ocw13uuimtr91.jpg?width=1412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f72e53ea9e30ba3d9b05429cbe72c89141ce230b)\n\nHardware has seen a massive upgrade with almost across the board implementation of Qualcomm\u2019s 8155P chip, a much more powerful SoC than anyone used previously. Meanwhile, Nvidia Orin chips are powering ADAS, and a number of vehicles have IPS/OLED screens, full-colour heads up displays, and Dolby Atmos audio.\n\nQuality of life features include glass roofs, leather interiors, electronically-adjustable seat bolsters, soft-closing doors, programmable interior *and* exterior LED lightning, pop-up spoilers, phone entry, and a bunch more. Check [this review of the Avatr 011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkMYP_xohw) to see just how far this goes.\n\nFinally, the design has taken a definite step up. These cars *look good*, with animated lighting features, flush door handles, diamond-stitched interiors, and an obvious step-up in design language consistency.\n\n[Rising R7](https://preview.redd.it/ia1tcc3tmtr91.jpg?width=2968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0802e88e0f2954ddad5d3353ebcadcc626e72409)\n\n# What\u2019s the pricing like?\n\nIncredibly competitive.\n\nMost of the TM3-fighters we\u2019re talking about here start in the \u00a5200K ($30K) range for their basic models. The Changan Shenlan 03, for instance, will come in at \u00a5183,900 (\\~$27,000) for a 515 km (CLTC) range model with a 5.9s 0-60, and many of the features I listed above, including Huawei\u2019s infotainment running on a Qualcomm 8155.\n\nOne of the most expensive of the bunch \u2014 the Li L9 \u2014 is an EREV offering six seats, a 5.5s 0-60 time, five OLED screens powered by dual Qualcomm 8155 chips, dual-sim 5G cellular connectivity, ADAS powered by dual Nvidia Orin chips, integrated LIDAR, air suspension, front-row massaging seats, a panoramic glass roof with an electric closing shade, and *a fridge in the centre console* for RMB 459,800\u2026 or roughly $65K USD. Phew.\n\n[First-class seating on the Li L9.](https://preview.redd.it/a10hr1vwmtr91.jpg?width=934&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d3ffd6cd9006ddaeb955a48194d2c9c5d2c6bfb)\n\n# Are there some more specific examples of models to watch?\n\nHell yeah. \n\n**Nio ET5**\n\nNio\u2019s ET5 is an interesting one in that at roughly $50K, it is positioned vaguely higher (not lower) than the Tesla Model 3, but what it offers is a compelling package for that price.. Standard features include 23-speaker Dolby Atmos audio, an AMOLED centre display, soft-close doors, pop-out handles, and customizable interior lighting. Nio\u2019s autonomous driving package includes 4x NVIDIA Orin chips, LIDAR, RADAR, and a full suite of 360\u00ba cameras, and is expected to receive continual OTA updates as it improves, just like Tesla\u2019s system. This is expected to be Nio's most consequential model, will likely become the volume seller for the brand.\n\nDeliveries started this week.\n\n[I like this yellow colour.](https://preview.redd.it/9ccqrjv4ntr91.jpg?width=1195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=561d0ca17398b9e340136e3b15b7da9182fcbb04)\n\n**Xpeng G9**\n\nThe Xpeng G9 offers 800V charging, a 550HP AWD powertrain that does 0-60 in under 4s, and a chassis packed with technology including dual 15\u201d screens, air suspension, and Xpeng\u2019s NGP Autopilot competitor. Xpeng\u2019s previous release, the P5, was a bit of a flop despite good reviews, and the G9 could be make-or-break for them. However, the offering is solid \u2014 this is the closest thing the Model Y has to a direct competitor at the same direct price.\n\nDeliveries start this month.\n\n[Xpeng calls the styling on the G9 a \\\\\"Robot Face\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/aw97kzbbntr91.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba8d3a40d81f973862abdcf3ae0f93f3a333c32b)\n\n**BYD Seal**\n\nYou know BYD already. They\u2019re a big deal, and the Seal is their big gun. Based on their new e-platform 3.0, it\u2019s starting delivery now, a direct TM3 competitor that dips down to around 210K (\\~$30K). For a trim level approaching the $40K TM3 base price, you can get one with 700 km (435mi) of CLTC range and a 300hp powertrain. You won\u2019t get many self-driving features or quality-of-life offerings like camp mode, but the interior is excellent, and the powertrain is solid. It\u2019s believed BYD could be producing as many as 15K per month in the short term, and they could approach an annual run-rate as much as 300K in the long-term.\n\nDeliveries started last month.\n\n[The BYD Seal is waterproof enough to serve briefly as a boat, clearly. ](https://preview.redd.it/mf3u52tyntr91.jpg?width=1589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd59ff3a6648fdb84daed08f002f3710478cf2a5)\n\n**Zeekr 001**\n\nGeely is already approaching a 100K annual run-rate on the Zeekr 001, a car priced in line with the Tesla Model 3 but nearly the size of a Tesla Model S. It comes equipped with Qualcomm 8155P IVI, Mobileye Supervision ADAS, and the usual luxury touches mentioned on the other vehicles, but the build quality is the star of the show here, with many reviewers noting that it comes off as a true global car.\n\nThis is Geely's first car on their [SEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Experience_Architecture_platform) platform, which will underpin every subsequent electric car by the conglomerate including the Polestar 3, Lotus Eletre, Smart #1, and Radar RD6 \u2014\u00a0all of these coming out over the *next few months.*\n\n[If only it came in a manual.](https://preview.redd.it/u0wwjq79otr91.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48126c1a23b8cca9870c93f57df9c3979eb29280)\n\n# Will they be made in quantity? Will they sell?\n\nIndisputably. Ramp up is already happening. Li just launched the L9 last month and has already delivered 10K units. Nio\u2019s ET5 is being delivered from their brand-new Neopark, a factory with an annual production capacity of up to 300K, with more reportedly planned. Aion is already selling 30K units per month of their models, and growing every month. Hozon Neta isn\u2019t far behind.\n\n[Aion is already selling close to 400K BEVs per year. ](https://preview.redd.it/kjteibnhotr91.jpg?width=1770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=552dff8e7af6f66ca8d72e24a7b2ae6c27b81a77)\n\nCustomers have started lining up and placing preorders by the tens of thousands on these brands in a way that they never had previously. Nio\u2019s ET5 launch [attracted crowds to their stores](https://cnevpost.com/2022/09/09/nio-et5-model-3-moment/) the moment demo models arrived.\n\n[Crowds at Nio for the launch of the ET5](https://preview.redd.it/wzgpktvvotr91.jpg?width=1261&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a0d6e51a8f92131337e4c0918da898d06cc5fc5)\n\n# What about the financials of these companies?\n\nHear me out: Largely irrelevant at the moment. Changan (Shenlan, Avatr), SAIC (Rising, iM), and GAC (Aion) are all state-owned, and structured for long-term success. Zeekr\u2019s parent Geely is, of course, the same company that owns Volvo, Polestar, and Lotus, already very profitable, and still growing strong.\n\nRight now, BYD is built for absurd levels of growth, and just passed a 2.2M run rate.\n\n[You can approximately halve these numbers to get the BEV figures.](https://preview.redd.it/5mjadnt1ptr91.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=342d015e066e070bc31d95141a201d80c5b71730)\n\nNio nearly bankrupted themselves a couple years back trying for extreme growth (much like Tesla in 2017) so they have some dodgy history, but they\u2019ve seemingly crawled out of that at this point.\n\nAs long as these companies can keep doing what they\u2019re doing, they will mostly grow.\n\n# What should I watch for in the future?\n\nSynergistic relationships are happening faster and more often, and are the trend to watch. I already mentioned how Huawei is making inroads to infotainment, providing the foundation for automakers to deliver better experiences. The next frontier is autonomy, with Huawei aiming to provide an out-of-the-box offering to the entire field of automakers in the same fashion, and Baidu, Xiaomi, and DJI making similar moves.\n\nCommoditization is happening at a rapid pace. Companies like [Midea](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3167402/chinas-ev-market-top-appliances-maker-mideas-us17-billion) are throwing money into developing off-the-shelf parts like heat pumps, silicon carbide inverters, electronic door handles, and air filtration systems. For small automakers, this means quicker options to help get to market without spending time doing component development \u2014 grow now, iterate later.\n\n# What does this mean for Tesla?\n\nIt\u2019s unknown with absolute certainty at this point. As I said before, I\u2019m not trying to suggest the sky is falling. We haven\u2019t seen long-term reviews of many of these models yet, nor what kind of long-term support these OEMs are going to put into iterating their designs. We\u2019ve seen some false starts before. Tesla retains an advantage in existing scale, brand awareness, maturity, and consistency.\n\nTesla has the wiggle room to maintain sales leadership in a way that some of these brands do not. However, it can be said there\u2019s a definite wave of credible competition forming, and what\u2019s clear right now is that the Chinese OEMs are moving faster to adopt new features and bring down cost than the western counterparts.\n\nIt\u2019s likely Tesla will decide to adjust pricing or incentives to compensate, as well as implement feature improvements to the lineup. I\u2019d expect that CDM 3/Y models will see some improvements on touchpoints and interior items at the least \u2014 revised seats, better interior lighting, improved displays, and electronic pop-out door handles are all strong possibilities.\n\n[Nio's ET5 has some absolutely gorgeous cabin lighting and OLED displays.](https://preview.redd.it/j30m7gt8ptr91.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3278d9b6cbf69f14cb6fe5d91abbd865ee240c43)\n\nTesla is [now rumoured to be heading towards a price cut in China](https://cnevpost.com/2022/09/30/tesla-to-cut-model-3-y-prices-china-report/), and has been offering [extended incentives for Tesla Insurance](https://cnevpost.com/2022/10/01/tesla-extends-insurance-subsidy-offered-in-china-to-year-end/). I would consider these firm defensive moves, and they certainly have more room to continue adjusting their offerings, but things definitely just got interesting.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nChinese OEMs are responding to the market, better and faster than anyone expected. The new generation of cars from Changan, SAIC, GAC, Nio, Xpeng, Neta, and Li have better powertrains, serious technology improvements, and are packed with features that appeal to value-seeking Chinese consumers.\n\nSince I asked my original question in response to Piper Sandler\u2019s [market share concerns](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/xr5unp/comment/iqdjjak/?context=999) statement a week ago, Tesla reported a delivery miss. For those of you ruminating on that news, this is one datapoint to consider. Chinese consumers\u2019 attentions are now divided among many competing brands in a way that they weren\u2019t before, and Tesla may have to start thinking about how to win that attention back.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/us03zxd2htr91.jpg?width=1449&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70ed788f28ce9992584eea6c420f67a745672e28", "id": "xvlbeq", "created_utc": 1664904904.0, "score": 504, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 229, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you very much, a very interesting post!\n\nI simply want to add some perspective, total car sales in China is around **20 Million per year**.

Not sure if I missed it but I didn\u2019t see profitability of these companies mentioned, and that\u2019s a major factor to consider. \n\nWhile state owned companies makes that complicated or some might argue close to irrelevant, it is important to consider since Tesla currently has almost $19B in deployable cash on hand as of last quarter, growing every quarter, and it\u2019s not tied to the economic conditions or needs of any particular problem within any country. And Apple as an example has shown that they can upend an entire industry like they did with Apple silicon, which basically re-lit the smothered fire under the GPU market and forced everyone to catch up. Apple leads and shapes the consumer electronic market whether people are willing and able to admit it or not, just like I believe Tesla currently is and will into the future. And a big part of that power comes from profitability. \n\nNot to say that competition in the market isn\u2019t something to be concerned about, but things like trim, pricing, specs, those can all be adjusted if need be within a quarter or maybe two to keep up with the competition. But things like the 4680 structural battery, gigapresses, and autonomy, those take much, much longer for the competition to catch up on, require huge capital investment and infrastructure, and the benefits of those compound into the future, both in the potential for the cars, supply chain, or anything else in the business.\n\nChinese companies definitely do more of that long term planning like you mentioned, especially compared to other American or European companies, but imo the profitability aspect is vital to any analysis, yet is also inherently nearly impossible to quantify because it is unknown what exactly it will lead to.

And i've been living in Paris, France for 8 of the past 10 or so years. \n\n15-20 years ago there were few if any Chinese tourists visiting Paris. I would go to some of the big department stores such as the Galleries Lafayette or the Printemps and there wasn't a single Chinese tourist in sight.\n\nFast forward to about 10 years ago until present day and if you go to those same department stores you would see literal lines out the door of the big designer name brands (Dior, Gucci, Prada, LVMH, etc). LVMH handbags are especially popular. The majority of those waiting in line... Chinese.\n\nOf course, the exception is that over the last couple of years there have been few tourists due to COVID resitrictionswhich are/were particularly strict going in and out of China for obvious reasons. \n\nAs such i would take any report using data gathered in the last couple of years with a grain of salt seeing as travel has been severely restricted which has obvious effects on consumer behavior.\n\nAlso note, i'm not really concerned with the lower/middle class. Not that they aren't important economically, but they likely weren't the ones buying the \"presitgious western brands\" to begin with.\n\nAnd.. as for the MCKinsey report, sorry but it's not very substantial. They don't even measure luxury fashion and the data doesn't exactly favor Chinese brands with regards to sportswear and footwear. Also Chinese brands have lost 18% market share in EVs? \n\nAnd then there's this entire paragraph which puts alot of doubts on the entire claim that Chinese consumer preferences are shifting towards local brands: ***\"Overall, while an increasing number of Chinese consumers claim to prefer domestic brands, in some cases, it may be that they are simply responding to brands that offer value for money and meet their needs. Previous McKinsey research highlighted that consumers are not always aware of which brands are foreign or domestic, and there is increasing ambiguity between the country of origin and the country of manufacture. Many Chinese consumers are so used to seeing global brands such as Olay and Biore that they may actually believe they are local. Some Chinese brands that have packaged themselves as \u201cinternational\u201d are often mistaken as foreign. Beingmate (a Chinese infant milk powder) was assumed to be a foreign brand by 45 percent of respondents.\"***\n\nRemember, what i'm specifically asking is if there's any evidence that the upper class consumers who previously were buying luxury goods from \"prestigious\" western brands (like LVMH handbags and BMWs) are now instead choosing to buy Luxury handbags from a Chinese brand, or luxury autos from a Chinese brand. And while the report does state that Chinese brands have secured a 6% market share in premium autos it also states ***\"Chinese premium automotive brands were essentially nonexistent just five years ago\"***. So it's not surprise they've gained share, Chinese consumers didn't have any option until recently. It also wouldn't surprise me to learn that the 6% of premium Chinese autos sold are EVs (noty sure if that's the case, but wouldn't surprise me).
