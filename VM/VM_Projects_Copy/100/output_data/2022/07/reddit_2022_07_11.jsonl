Buying NFLX pre-pandemic was solid move now with this market saturation, if they can't produce quality content with atleast 1 good show every month they are done. First order of business should be to stop the binge model. League Arcane showed that 3 week delivery works well and keeps suspence. The binge model worked to grow rapidly but with reduced show slate they need to think about that because they deliver 1 good show a month and you watch it in 2 days - so the attention retantion is very low, not a good mix. The old model 1 episode every week is also flawed because that is actually annoying to the viewer but I think that the 3 week - 3 episode delivery might be a key to new highs for Netflix. They can deliver less volume in terms of shows but higher quality and improve viewer experience and platform attention retantion which I think is one of their biggest problems at the moment.   \nAnother very weak side is subtitles. It should cost very little to attack foreign markets but you need the subtitles for it otherwise you are crippled.

You don't get $131. You get the $124 call strike for the short 100 shares.\n\nLet's go over the same results again and see if we can uncover the mistake. For one thing, instead of grouping the shorts together vs. the longs, it's more conventional to do the gain/loss of the put wing vs. the call wing.\n\nThe 119/115p short put wing expires OTM for a max profit of (1.25 - 0.39) = $0.86.\n\nThe 128/124c short call wing expires ITM for a max loss of (4.00 - 1.05 + 0.38) = -$3.33\n\nNet of the two together 0.86 - 3.33 = -$2.47 loss. Confirming what the book said.\n\nYou may be wondering how the max loss of the call wing was calculated. When the short call expires, you have to deliver 100 shares at $124. Since you don't have 100 shares, you end up short 100 shares but only receive $124 in return, despite the shares costing $131 to cover.

The stock price has risen to 105. I obviously know that this option has made money, but how is the money made exactly?\n\nSome corrections:\n\n* We need to know the premium price (how much it cost to open) to know if it made money or not. If you paid $1 million for the call and it loses $12000 a day to theta decay, it is far more likely to have lost money than gained it to a 105 stock move (assuming it started at 100).\n\n* We also need to know the moneyness of the call at the time it was opened. If the stock started at $42 at open, making the call far OTM, a rise to $105 will make a lot more money for the call than if it started at $169 ITM and fell to $105.\n\n* But if you meant it started at 100 and ended up at 105, the call **may or may not have made money**. It isn't a sure bet that it made money just because the stock went up $5. Again, starting and ending premium price of the call is the most important factor here.\n\nExplainer for why a call doesn't necessarily make money just because the stock goes up: \n\n**FAQ: Why did my options lose value when the stock price moved favorably?**\n\n* [Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value)\n\n-------------------\n\nNow, to answer your question, it's actually quite simple. The reason a call contract gains value is *because the market bid the price up*. That's it. That's the whole reason. If the price of the call was originally $2.00 and the stock went up to $105, the market might decide it is now worth $2.69.\n\nWhen the market thinks a contract becomes more valuable, the price is bid up. If the market thinks a contract becomes less valuable, the price is bid down. Price is discovered through trading. That's the beginning and end of it.\n\n> Is the call sold back to a other buyer?\n\nThat is the best way, yes, though who the buyer is doesn't matter. If you buy shares of Apple stock and later sell them, do you think you sell those shares back to the same person you bought them from? No. Your mental model is you sell them on the open market. Options work the same way. So just think of options as stock that has a deadline. You trade them the same way, buy low, sell high at a later date, but before expiration. If you can't sell high at a later date, because the call's value was bid down, you might end up taking a loss. Exactly like shares.\n\n> Or is it exercised and now the trader and buys shares for 100 and then immediately sells it?\n\nThe big bold advisory at the top of this page is basically never exercise your option contracts and don't hold option contracts to expiration.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45002084970474243}, {"body": "How do you choose a strike price for an option?\n\nIs it based on the options breakeven and you want your entry price to be that b/e price\n\n or \n\nbased on if you want to be itm or otm when the option expires?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "*Introductory Trading Commentary*   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;**[Monday School Introductory trade planning advice (PapaCharlie9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool)**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;*Strike Price*   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;[Options Basics: How to Pick the Right Strike Price (Elvis Picardo - Investopedia)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021014/options-basics-how-pick-right-strike-price.asp)  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;[High Probability Options Trading Defined (Kirk DuPlessis, Option Alpha)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWHh2co80M)   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;*Breakeven*  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;[Your break-even (at expiration) isn't as important as you think it is (PapaCharlie9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m0m7at/monday_school_your_breakeven_isnt_as_important_as/)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6990928053855896}, {"body": "There is no sweat spot with strikes, unless you are selling. \n\nBuying ITM, ATM, OTM, and far OTM have their list of pros and cons", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43153318762779236}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4447256624698639}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The market index has been showing declining trends since January, and has not shown an upward trend, on a daily candle basis when looking at a three month period.  \n\nIf the market stays down, or resumes down trends, you may be losing on a long call or short put at 400.  \n\nAre you prepared to lose on the trade? \n\nCash can be a useful and strategic trading position.  \n\nThere are no medals given out for calling a bottom.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.025793908163905144}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.010023100301623344}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Options amount to a rental of a position.   \nEventually the lease is up, and if the underlying fails to gain, you have a loss.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.04722955822944641}, {"body": "CONS:\n\nSmaller profit", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02452259510755539}, {"body": "What expiration? \"LEAPS\" doesn't tell us how long to expiration, only that is might be more than 1 year.

Now, having said both of those things, I\u2019ll add the following:\n\nMarket markers in VOO typically provide ample liquidity for you to be able to execute your trade at an efficient price. While it\u2019s not as heavily traded (volume) as SPY, the market will still meet your needs as a retail investor. The kind of liquidity that someone trading with $10M USD is different from someone trading $1,000 or even $10,000. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily let liquidity be something that determines whether it would be SPY or VOO that you focus on, since for your order spread and size, there will be plenty of MM liquidity to absorb whatever you want to enter into or exit out of in terms of a trade.\n\nThe second thing pertaining to the expense ratio is related to your long term objectives\u2014remember, if you own a call option (or a put option), you do not own the underlying security (VOO in this case) until the option is exercised. So the expense ratio will only impact your position in terms of how the market prices that ETF based on the ongoing carry cost of the buy and hold investor. For example: Suppose VOO is trading at $100, and the expense ratio is 2% (using simplistic example here, not reality, just to make the math easy); In a perfect world then, if absolutely nothing in the universe changed, after 1 year the theoretical price would be $98. Now, of course nothing in the universe is perfect, and things change very much over the course of a year, but for an options investor who owns calls in the ETF, typically if the options are short maturity (a few weeks to a few months away from expiration), then the carry cost/expense ratio isn\u2019t perfectly factored into the ETF price, and becomes almost negligible (especially with very small expense ratios), in comparison to underlying economic factors and metrics that have a greater impact on the underlying securities that are shelf by that fund. So, expense ratio is something to consider as an options trader, but isn\u2019t prevalent in your calculation unless you are looking at long dated maturities.\n\nIf, on the other hand, your intention is to eventually own the actual ETF (VOO) as opposed to the options, then the expense ratio has to be something that is central to your calculation, because by definition it is telling you how much money will be used by the fund each year for administrative and management costs.\n\nToday VOO closed at $349.99, so to my point earlier, if you wanted to buy a call option at the $350 strike, you are essentially controlling $35,000 worth of the index fund. Without the option approach, if I wanted to buy 100 shares of VOO, I would require $35,000. Obviously the options would be cheaper, but there is a substantially higher risk that the 350 calls will be worthless in a few days, in which case the entire value of my investment in the 350 calls goes to $0. It\u2019s one of those dangerous things about options. If it\u2019s even a penny below the strike at expiry, it\u2019s worthless.\n\nThe more dangerous thing you have to be careful about is if it\u2019s in the money and you\u2019re close to expiry but it\u2019s still slightly below your break even. Your broker will margin call the position and you\u2019ll be forced to sell without any choice, even if the value jumps in the last few minutes on expiration\u2014you\u2019ll miss out and take the L.\n\nOne thing you may have already noticed is that on options expiration, the last hour is when everything gets hot. Positions are being closed, spreads are being rolled into the next expiration, volatility spikes and volume increases SUBSTANTIALLY. These are the times when directional trades that are close to the money either become very profitable or very costly, mostly because they\u2019ve lost all of their time value (theta), and are trading purely on the value of the underlying (delta).\n\nDefinitely a great idea to get in the habit of practicing placing orders and monitoring your position. Paper trades are useful, but when you start doing the real thing just remember to keep your stops tight. Have discipline. Try to follow a rules based strategy as much as you can. Get out of positions that are losing, even if they might turn around. Trade often but don\u2019t over trade. It\u2019s probably one of the most common reasons for failure. Don\u2019t be afraid of failure, it will be your best teacher and it will happen. Just don\u2019t let the same failures be your common mistake. Learn and adjust. Learn some more and adjust some more.\n\nHave fun, and believe in yourself!

This refers to the situation where a stock is making a very sizable drop in price, and appears to be a good value. The phrase is a metaphor for a very bad idea, who in their right mind would literally try to catch a falling knife, which has enough downward velocity to injure you? The logic of the warning is that it isn't a certainty to know how far a stock might drop, before it eventually finds support. And it is easy to blow up your portfolio when your timing is off.

He's kind of a big deal in the investing world. He's written hundreds of papers for professional and academic publications. He's the head of Research Affiliates, whose index strategies are used to manage tens of billions for companies like Schwab and Invesco. Arnott also personally co-manages several gigantic funds for PIMCO. He made probably the most accurate prediction of any major commentator for overall market returns before and during the dot-com bubble. \n\nHe co-wrote a paper called \"the Big Market Delusion: Electric Vehicles\" which calmly and rationally explained why Tesla is not a good investment and the entire EV sector is in a bubble. For example: \n\n>As of the end of January 2021, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization had risen to $752 billion, placing it in the top 10 companies in the world by market value. At that market capitalization, Tesla accounted for about 75% of the total EV group\u2019s market value and 35% of the market value of the entire auto industry. Such an immense market capitalization makes sense only if the expectation is that Tesla will come to dominate the entire auto industry, not just the EV market. **Such an achievement requires that both Tesla\u2019s brand and technology become so dominant that the company can earn profit margins that exceed those of Ferrari on a level of production exceeding that of Toyota.** If that is the scenario reflected in Tesla's price, it should also be reflected in the falling valuations of its competitors, including competing EV specialists, whose market share will presumptively decline in favor of Tesla\u2014however, the reverse is true. While Tesla\u2019s stock price has been skyrocketing, the prices of competing EV firms have been too. [...] \n\n>Tesla led global EV sales in 2020 with 15% of EV market share. In China, the world\u2019s largest EV market, the Tesla Model 3 topped the 2020 sales list with a 6% EV market share. Even so, its sales remained small compared to the major traditional manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Toyota. **To justify its current valuation, Tesla must grow by an order of magnitude (or two!), while increasing its margins at the expense of competitors.** As we noted previously, the market is projecting a similar growth rate for most of Tesla\u2019s EV competition.\n\nread the paper here: https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=127087120097028125078087106082006030022041017031027078099094026106009073127119012030001121005122042126107026093095103027017065046034013064088072021071092105019023100086036012093025020110088031127066106085117127121027025031089069092005116077076028093095&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">Allow me to introduce Mr. Rob Arnott.

And we also haven\u2019t made a recent higher high since May 2nd. \n\nTime wise- we have spent 53 days below 25.5 and we have spent 76 days above 25.5 this year that means 58.9% of this year has been spent with the VIX >25.5.\n\nOkay still with me here? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2z2ewnwpua91.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fc57652a416756b8756a97fa38a28a07b0e8404\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqhhvwyxpua91.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6b6dae50edc2250c6df709f8b84b77d12bafda\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ciodch0zpua91.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f8f1db57303d9b5b5264fbb26c6eb708a033be\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sk6wxgk0qua91.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=10b37253bc129fb738b57142b287fa7e36d19276\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3yfgozt1qua91.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb93c9d5a1f2fb96b48bcf717d5ca8ea8e81ade0\n\nIF my calculations, predictions and overall suspicions are correct we should see the VIX \u201cbottom\u201d tomorrow. Currently I have 24 as a support for the vix but It doesn\u2019t have to hit that. We should then see the VIX rising from Tuesday July 12th until two days before FOMC on July 27th. \n\nThis means Tomorrow should be loading time (anything in the 24s especially) and July 25th should be time to SELL. \n\nCurrent positions (picture below for proof) as UVXY August 19th 20C and August 16th 35C. I opened these last week when I saw the vix break the 26.7 trend line it has been holding onto since June 10th. However, I was on vacation/ had the wedding so I couldn\u2019t properly sit down a do some TA/ DD like this to open a bigger position. Tomorrow morning I plan to add more to this position and let them ride until July 25th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hn683uk2qua91.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5a124b9733a28ba145af30e49193e6987dcee8\n\nWhat does this mean for Spy, the markets as a whole and other stocks? Well most likely Friday was the PEAK and we are now getting ready for our next sell off. IF this truly is just like January and we are about to get the \u201cbig one\u201d and see \u201ccapitulation\u201d finally this is the perfect storm and they have set the VIX up perfectly to do it. We are yet to get the holy shit the worlds ending VIX 40-60s, everyone dumping everything they have and full on capitulation that we need to reach a bottom. I think we were close June 8th to June 17th but we didn\u2019t quite seal the deal. \n\nIf my calculations are correct we are about to see the next Sell off from July 11th until July 25th and I suspect this when we see SPY hit 330-340. \n\nThe one question that we don\u2019t know the answer to yet and could be an even bigger catalyst to take SPY to the 200s is that we have GDP for q2 on July 28th (the day after FOMC) and IF this locks in a negative reading we are CONFIRMING we are in a recession. This with q3 earnings starting End of January is going to be either a MASSIVE downward or upward catalyst. \n\nOn Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT\n\nOn July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google\n\nOn July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.\n\nOn July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel\n\nThe week of July 25th is going to be one hell of a wild week for the markets. With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven\u2019t already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July. \n\nWhat if im wrong? Whats the worst case scenario and time to cut bait on VIX/ UVXY calls? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss5gzz93qua91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef138f7f50dc86aa4b56e3601b942b9fd77739c3\n\nIF we were to get CPI this week to come in way under. I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don\u2019t see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. \n\nAll I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC\u2026 Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July. I think July is about to be capitulation month for SPY and the markets.", "id": "vw7sc0", "created_utc": 1657507110.0, "score": 397, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 216, "comments": [{"body":
