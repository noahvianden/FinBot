{"title": "Apple already decimated Meta\u2019s ad-tech empire. Now, it\u2019s homing in on Facebook\u2019s advertisers, too.", "selftext": "In terms of Silicon Valley feuds, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find one that\u2019s spicier than the years-long battle between Meta and Apple. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg started steering his company toward virtual-reality tech, and now Apple CEO Tim Cook has made it clear he\u2019s gunning for the same. Meta\u2019s Facebook recently started testing out encrypted chats, a domain that Apple has dominated for years. \n\nFacebook is a company that historically hasn\u2019t shied away from sharing user data with countless third parties. Meanwhile Apple AAPL, -0.67%, as its own glitzy ad campaigns constantly remind us, is the one tech company that doesn\u2019t spray your data across the web. And, of course, there\u2019s Apple\u2019s recent privacy changes to its operating system that wiped out an estimated $10 billion of revenue for Meta META, -0.54%. At the same time, the advertisers that relied on the long-established tools on Facebook and Instagram were left without the data they long relied on for their businesses.\n\nIn the year since Apple CEO Tim Cook denounced ad-based business models as a source of real-world violence, Apple has ramped up plans to pop more ads into people\u2019s iPhones and beef up the tech used to target those ads. And now it looks like Apple\u2019s looking to poach the small businesses that have relied almost entirely on Facebook\u2019s ad platform for more than a decade. MarketWatch found two recent job postings by Apple that suggest the company is looking to build out its burgeoning ad-tech team with folks who specialize in working with small businesses. Specifically, the company says it\u2019s looking for two product managers who are \u201cinspired to make a difference in how digital advertising will work in a privacy-centric world\u201d and who want to \u201cdesign and build consumer advertising experiences.\u201d An ideal candidate, Apple said, won\u2019t only be savvy in advertising and mobile tech, and advertising on mobile tech, but will also have experience with \u201cperformance marketing, local ads or enabling small businesses.\u201d \n\nThe listings also state that Apple\u2019s looking for a manager who can \u201cdrive multi-year strategy and execution,\u201d which suggests that Apple isn\u2019t just tailing local advertisers but will likely be tailing those advertisers for a while. And considering how some of those small brands are already looking to jump ship from Facebook following Apple\u2019s privacy changes, luring them off the platform might be enough to hamper Meta\u2019s entire business structure for good, ad-tech analysts said. \u201cIf you talk to any small business, they\u2019ll tell you, \u2018Yeah, right now is a disaster,\u201d said Eric Seufert, one analyst who\u2019s been following the battle between Apple and Facebook evolve for  years. \u201cIt\u2019s just a meltdown.

Not only YT, but Tiktok is also extremely popular (more popular than both FB and Insta I would say). However, the thing with these platforms is that their profit margins are lower, because you're paying a dividend to creators. In terms of FB and Insta (maybe with the exception of Reels), there is no need to pay anyone to create anything, which is incredibly valuable in terms of the actual financials of the company. In the same way, Google has to pay billions (16 billion i believe) a year to Apple in order to keep their search engine as the default search engine on Safari. The other thing is you are correct that Google has tons of data because of search, but that is search data not reccommendations data. Google's search data can be used very much to optimize their search algorithms (search intent), but that data isn't really catered for recommendations (when ur trying to recommend things that people didn't even know they wanted). The reasoning is that you can't serve people search options that they didn't search for. Of course, Google has YT, but whether YT's data is better than FB/Insta's data is a whole other discussion, honestly no one knows the answer to that except for the zucc.

Google login is by far the most popular.  That is key for Google.\n\nThis is what is so bad for Meta.  They have lossing accounts while Google continues to grow theirs.\n\nThe two are going in opposite directions.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes you are correct, I am definitely aware that Google was not affected by the ios privacy changes, since they serve results based on search intent. Meta was definitely affected by IOS privacy changes, which is why their revenue YoY declined that quarter. I do not necessary agree with the fact that Meta's revenue will CONTINUALLY go to Google, partially because the iOS changes were taken into affect last year around April 2021. So far, we are already more than one year after this date and I feel that many advertising agencies have already adjusted their budgets and allocated more to Google. But you are correct that more companies are going to be cracking down on privacy, like Google itself, but so far many people don't believe it will be as bad as the IOS changes (we don't know for sure). But to be clear, the privacy update was basically limiting the exchange of information across different apps. Within the FB and Insta app, they still are able to track whatever they want, and no one will ever take this away. In regards to privacy, that is a whole other discussion, and I don't want to get into that because we're going to be here for another couple hours. But I believe in the longer term though, you can improve recommendations algorithms much more than you can improve search algorithms. I feel that there is not much more room to squeeze revenue out of users from search because you can't really show them the things they didn't even know they wanted. But in terms of recommendations, the algorithm could always get better! Again, I have so much more to say, but I need to stop here. The great thing is that in 10 years, we will see what happens!!

Looks like he controlled his losses pretty well.\n\nEdit:  On further reading on business insider, it looks like he exercised call options at a strike price of $100.  Technically, that means then that he shouldn't have lost $345k or so but that he exercised a call option of $100 dollars a share for 20k shares, so $2 million.  If he sold at 165, that means he made a profit of $1.3 million.  I do not see how they got, nor do they explain, the loss of $345k.  (Maybe from the high of the week/month, or from the high of the exercise of the call option?)\n\nEdit#2:  Looking at the timing of the article on businessinsider (July 27th), it seems that they calculated the loss from what he would have made had he sold on 7/21, which was $181.44.  Since he sold on the 27th at 165.05 that would be a loss of ($-327,800), somewhat in line with what the article claimed as being $341k or so.
