(JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon's total compensation rose to $84.4 million for 2021, up from $31.7 million in 2020, according to the bank's annual proxy statement filed Monday. The figure includes $52.6 million in option awards for 2021, up from no option awards in 2020. \"The special award granted to Mr. Dimon reflects the board's desire for him to continue to lead the firm for a further significant number of years,\" the company said. \"The board also took into account other factors, including the firm's strong performance under Mr. Dimon's stewardship since 2005, his exemplary leadership, and his significant contributions to the firm's success during his tenure.\" Dimon's total annual compensation in 2021 rose to $34.5 million from $31.5 million in 2020 and 2019. The increase was due to a $3 million boost he received in performance share units (PSUs) to $28 million in 2021 from $25 million. His salary remained at $1.5 million. Shares of JP Morgan Chase are down 14.6% so far in 2022, compared to a drop of 4.6% by the S&P 500 and a loss of 4.2% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\n\\-Steve Gelsi\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n04-04-22 0730ET\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\n**Footnote**: JPMorgan reached an all-time high of **$172.96** on October 25, 2020.

Most home borrowers aren\u2019t affected, because they have long-term, fixed-rate mortgages\n\nThis is correct the sense that interest rates have less impact on current borrowers, but it will still have a negative impact on the housing market because less people are going to be taking out new mortgages if rate changes make repayments unaffordable. If buyers dry up house prices are likely to drop and that is a problem in the same way stocks dropping are. Another thing to consider here is that if the cost of living rises because of high inflation and employment drops as a result monetary tightening this will compound any fall in house prices.\n\nI agree that stocks are screwed if the FED is serious, but I still think that is yet to be seen. I'm still not 100% convinced the FED is stupid enough to believes it can fix a war in Europe and international supply-chain disruptions with rate hikes. It's likely recent comments are just an attempt to jawbone the market and inflation expectations lower. If at some point they start to hint at their inability to bring inflation down to reasonable levels near-term and suggest they may be looking ease hiking that would probably be a buying opportunity. That's not what's happening right now though. At the moment they're only getting more hawkish. Arguably they're actually starting to sound panicked about inflation.\n\nI'm still fully invested because there's a clear path where stocks act as an inflation hedge and the FED backs off sooner than the market fears, but I've used this bounce to de-risk significantly.

However with Omicron and variants, it's much harder to keep the infection rate low, and one of the reasons for maintaining the containment policy for now is to buy time to get more old people vaccinated.

Definitely not also because of the largest instance of debt monetization in the history of mankind.\n\nThis behavior jeopardizes the USD\u2019s status as the reserve currency of the world.\n\n\nEdit: Not saying that expanding the money supply is the only factor driving inflation. Supply chain issues, as we\u2019ve been experiencing, increases inflation. Supply chain issues + expanding the money supply makes inflation even worse; it exacerbates inflation. I\u2019m also not saying it was a bad thing for the Fed to respond as quickly and vigorously as they did. I do, however, think it was a mistake to add 2 trillion more to their balance sheet from August 2020 until now, amid increasing demand pressures and supply shortages. They kept adding to their balance sheet, expanding the money supply, even as the US made it through the eye of its economic storm.\n\nI also chose 401ks as a reference point to compare against. 9 trillion is hard to conceive of. Thought that a unit of comparison would help. Other comparisons. US GDP = approx. 25 trillion. California GDP = approx. 3.5 trillion. Texas GDP = approx. 2 trillion. NY GDP = approx. 2 trillion.
