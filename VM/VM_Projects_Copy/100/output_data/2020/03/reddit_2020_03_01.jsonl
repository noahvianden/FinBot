But the worst is yet to come. We predict that the peak of the impact of Covid-19 on global supply chains will occur in mid-March, forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe. The most vulnerable companies are those which rely heavily or solely on factories in China for parts and materials. The activity of Chinese manufacturing plants has fallen in the past month and is expected to remain depressed for months.\n\nMany analyses compare the current epidemic with the [2002-2003 SARS epidemic](https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/), which created just a blip in the global financial markets. This comparison is dangerous because the relative importance of China in the worldwide economic ecosystem has increased tremendously in the past 18 years: China has more than doubled its share of trade with the rest of the world between the SARS epidemic and today, and many more industries are now heavily dependent on China. The SARS epidemic started in the Guangdong province in 2002 and led to 8,000 cases in 2003. During that year, the GDP of China represented 4.31% of the world GDP. By contrast, the number of detected cases of Covid-19 has already passed 80,000 and China represents about 16% of the world GDP, an almost four-fold increase.\n\nEqually important, mounting pressure to reduce supply chain costs motivated companies to pursue strategies such as lean manufacturing, offshoring, and outsourcing. Such cost-cutting measures mean that when there is a supply-chain disruption, manufacturing will stop quickly because of a lack of parts. The vast majority of global companies have [no idea of what their risk exposure](https://hbr.org/2014/01/from-superstorms-to-factory-fires-managing-unpredictable-supply-chain-disruptions) to what is going on in Asia actually is; that\u2019s because few, if any, have complete knowledge of the locations of all the companies that provide parts to their direct suppliers.\n\nGiven the current efforts by the Chinese government to [quarantine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/asia/coronavirus-china-wuhan-quarantine.html) almost one half of its population and the negative impact that\u2019s having on transportation and manufacturing activities in the country, we can safely conclude that the impact of Covid-19 on Chinese manufacturing is at least an order of magnitude larger than that of SARS.\n\nAs a result of events such as the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, the March 2010 Iceland\u2019s volcano eruption, Japan\u2019s earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, and the flood in Thailand in August 2011, companies increased the amount of inventory they keep on hand. But they still usually carry only 15 to 30 days\u2019 worth of inventory. It is possible that the Chinese New Year week-long vacation motivated some companies to increase their inventory coverage by another week. So, for most companies, the inventory coverage they have will allow them to match their supplies with demand, with no additional supply, for between two to five weeks, depending on the company\u2019s supply chain strategy. If the supply of components is disrupted longer, manufacturing will have to stop.\n\nSupply lead times will also have an impact. Shipping by sea to either the U.S. or Europe takes, on average, 30 days. This implies that if Chinese plants stopped manufacturing prior to the beginning of the Chinese holiday on January 25, the last of their shipments will be arriving the last week of February.\n\nAll this suggests that there will be a spike in the temporary closures of assembly and manufacturing facilities in mid-March.\n\nSome manufacturers have already had to throttle back production in their plants outside of China, and the list gets longer by the day. For example, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV [announced](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-pinching-car-industry-supply-chains-2020-02-14?mod=mw_quote_news) on February 14 that \u201cit is temporarily halting production at a car factory in Serbia because it can\u2019t get parts from China.\u201d Similarly, Hyundai [said](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/coronavirus-exposes-cracks-in-carmakers-chinese-supply-chains) that it \u201cdecided to suspend its production lines from operating at its plants in Korea \u2026 due to disruptions in the supply of parts resulting from the coronavirus outbreak in China.\u201d These two examples are consistent with our analysis: Because lead times from China to these countries are significantly shorter than 30 days, the disruption occurs earlier.\n\nThe challenge is also significant in the high-tech industry. Indeed, on February 17, Apple [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/02/investor-update-on-quarterly-guidance/) it expected its quarterly earnings to be lower than previously expected. The company refers to two challenges, a constrained global supply of iPhones and significant drop in demand in Chinese markets.\n\nOther industries are also being hit by this double whammy. One global consumer-packaged-goods manufacturer told us that its sales in China this month are 50% lower than in February 2019. Consider also products such as bridal gowns, many of which are produced in China and sold all over the world. According to [this report](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/business/wedding-gowns-coronavirus/index.html), the current shutdown of Chinese manufacturing facilities specializing in these products will lead to a significant supply shortage for the upcoming summer wedding season.\n\nThe widening coronavirus epidemic is already affecting ports. Allard Castelein, the CEO of Rotterdam harbor [said](https://www.rd.nl/vandaag/economie/gevolgen-coronavirus-merkbaar-in-haven-rotterdam-1.1631860), \u201cThe effect of the coronavirus is already visible. The number of departures from Chinese ports has decreased by 20% these days.\u201d Activity at the French port of Le Havre is also slowing and [could drop](https://www.lci.fr/sante/video-l-economie-du-port-du-havre-impactee-par-le-coronavirus-2145885.html) by 30% within two months. And the anticipated impact on U.S. ports is starting to be [factored into financial analyses](https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/riskreward-proposition-increasingly-in-question-as-coronavirus-lingers?post=251375&page=all).\n\nIn summary, we believe we should brace for a major effect on manufacturing worldwide.

News stories hitting right now discuss how there is simply no plan for:\n\n1. Surge numbers in hospitals.  Surge capacity in disasters is crushing, and numbers far beyond a bad flu season Saturday.  Pray you catch it soon while your nurses have still had sleep.\n2. The collapse of the retail, non-internet economy.  No way people are going out in public in two weeks.  Forget all big events of any kind by the end of this week.\n3. Right now as I read stories, production resumes in affected areas in China, the questions become deep: who drives the product? (no drivers)  To where? (can I even get to the port which might be shipping and to where?)  To do what with it? (no one will be where this arrives to make this into anything)  To sell to who??? (who in the world is buying non essentials over the next month, and forget luxury items).\n4. The psychological toll of increasing death and infection numbers in the millions.  I always feared the most insane scenario of us eventually hitting numbers past SARS.  We already did, and this is just beginning.  If Hhundreds of thousands of cases are showing up throughout the world this week \\*\\* then thisis the sign above all you need to splash iceberg-tier water on your face\\*\\* as those numbers instantly turn into utter global catastrophe.\n5. Even if the outbreak is mystically somehow only half-terrible, we are looking dead square at severe political instability, borders closing, emergency service personnel getting quarantined (e.g. the firefighters case that just occurred is very telling).\n\nPeople attempt to compare this to market over-excitement and numbers issues causing past corrections.  Lol.  Denial.  This is not the mis-pricing of some housing bundles. Think of the trivial stuff that caused past recessions.  Possibly depressions.  Numbers and money games.\n\nThis is a bit more akin to a meteor being present in the sky, clearly heading at our face, and NASA saying 'it is nothing to worry about since \"it is not that big, just the size of 2-3 texas, and it is getting smaller, and we have the best meteor absorbing atmosphere.  I think ever.  Meteors hit us all the time.\"\n\nIf the world started a stunning, A-game global response to this tomorrow, there would be a real reason for hope.  There would be light at the end of a \\*very\\* inconvenient tunnel.  But few, if any, countries are prepared to act with the swift lockdown and mega-scale construction China achieved.  They had people standing outside of each apartment complex and on every block enforcing travel and quarantine.   Areas without party-enforcement mechanisms were paying hard-cash to neighbors to report on each other.  That is what it takes to beat this.\n\nIn summary, take the few data points we have and get the balls to draw a line through them.  It plummets straight down.  So, enjoy profiting off the market fall this week.  (Monday could rally, but the market is a dead-crimson-black by open on Tuesday about 8 days from now)\n\nSpend every dollar (or at least 40%) that you make tomorrow on Tuesday and Wednesday on useful material items.

{"title": "Message from ya boi", "selftext": "[Edit: this message was from like 3/1 or 2/29 idr and got removed on accident and no I\u2019m not summarizing it for y\u2019all lol- Reida]\n\n\nHello, my beloved WSB. There are actually WSBers in prison! In most jails you have Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, etc. Now you can gain jail gang credibility by \"claiming\" an affiliation with Wall Street Bets (kidding, of course). Anyway, how about those trillion dollar companies?\r\n\r\nPolitics, you ask? I am trying to quit (but crosspost this to r/thedonald anyway). Also, I'm woke now. I've tried to give a group of people here a seriously woke #metoo makeover. It didn't work. In all seriousness: there is a lot of homophobia, racism and mysogyny in jail. It is lamentable, but surprising and amusing when you are the most conservative guy \"on the street\" (jail slang for \"when you're not in prison\") and the most liberal guy in jail. It is a pretty weird feeling lecturing everyone on not using certain words! Or accepting the humanity of LGBT people. But, I'll be out of here fairly soon and this will be the last time I'll have to defend respecting women to ingrate inmates. It really is that \"upside down\" here: I'm the SJW white knight.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Trump has done well in the last 6-12 months, needless to say. Incumbents are rarely unseated, and the conditions required for a one-term presidency don't exist, other than in the mind of Trump's more strident and acidic critics. Trump passed tax cuts, FSA, judicial appointments and various other legislative victories that actually make him one of the most productive presidents ever. He has done much better at harnessing his preternatural publicity powers for good and avoiding ugly moments like Charlottesville-type gaffes. The other team hasn't played as well with the incessant fire alarm-pulling of the media and Congress tiring the nation out and lending credence to Trump's complaints of bias.\r\n\r\nBloomberg is the most appropriate Democratic candidate for President. He's accomplished far more than any Democrat politician (compare him to Sanders, for instance), dealt well with all types of complexity, not just in financial software, but also in media, and of course the little political fiefdom known as New York City. He ran the city relatively well, but some technocratic autism leaks out, here and there (soda ban). Forgive the neuroatypical one. He's fairly clumsy with his words (watch his Spanish translations for a good laugh)--but he's a much smarter manager who doesn't let ego or reckless conviction get in the way of good decisions. I don't think his \"world views\" are actually authentic--he ostensibly pledges allegiance to the woke police, but deep down, he is a dirty capitalist billionaire who ideally will not burn the bridge down for the rest of us since he's crossed it himself.\r\n\r\n  What can be said about Bernie that hasn't been said by the Wall Street Journal already? He really is a dangerous ideologue. A simple way to defuse Sanders is to ask him a direct question: is there a business or a businessperson you admire? Anywhere in the world? In essence, every American is a businessperson, other than politicians/government. Those roles are very important, but without business and wealth generation, goverment cannot 'service' the citizenry. There has to be some core productivity, consumption and trade or there is no keystone to build an economy on. State-owned enterprises have succeeded but they still only really work when they have capitalist incentives (China is the best example of SEOs doing quite well).\r\n  Sadly, Sanders is the type who has been screaming bloody murder for the last 50 years of his life while our country has rose to ever greater heights of prosperity. There does not exist a condition where he wouldn't complain, at the same volume. This irrational perspective works in politics, but real people won't buy it. Polls and even primaries miss the key variable you need to model in a general election: turnout. \r\n  I think statistics prove income inequality is a left-wing myth. Sanders' theories are akin to MMT: there is no magical money tree. With $4T annual spending and $3T in annual taxes, it is hard to envision a scenario where he can really fund a major expansion of entitlements. He recently has bragged about his health policy being projected to save $300 billion. We know how well projects work in politics, but CNN interviewers failed to make the retort: is that a big deal? No, actually. That sounds great, but it's a modest 10% difference from current healthcare spending, if it achieves fruition, in a time where political economic forecasts almost never do. \r\n\r\n  Bernie is actually from my exact neighborhood in Brooklyn. We even attended the same elementary school, PS 197. (Quick aside, I wrote my first line of code--in BASIC--there in 1st grade on an Apple 2E.) Sanders will continue to tap into the high-school/college/post-college angst of youth and those who never grew up. It's surprising this minority is so vocal in America--that is really the bigger issue. Stupidity is a bit cyclical and it has been a while since a major economy tried real socialism; its advocates, whether fools or actually nefarious, have an opening to promote the ideology. The problem with this class is they're victims of the fraud of \"higher education\" or, much worse, are some combination of lazy and/or jaded/disaffected. Bernie is just the echo product of folks who are upset a $500,000 education is a scam. The fleecing of the middle class by this idea, one of the greatest lies ever told, that one has to go to a competitive college, followed by a competitive grad school, is a more real and tragic driver of income inequality. If Mark Zuckerberg can become the 5th richest man (at his age!) and I attended City College for $2,000 a semester, while you pay $100,000/year for NYU or Penn State (no offense to alums), you may also still be rooting for $DRYS to come back. I can't blame these folks. It's not entirely appealing to finish school and become an entry-level worker at GE or AMZN, hoping to reach middle management in five years. Nor is running into the open arms of GS, JPM or BAC after an MBA fulfilling. It would never have worked for me. Entrepreneurs understand they're playing economic and personal Russian roulette, in a sense. That's also not for everyone. Why can't we have utopia? Despite sympathizing with this plight, Sanders doesn't have the answer, even if he speaks to the worries of a generation increasingly lied to. \"Learn to code.\"\r\n\r\n  On other candidates: Warren gets her just desserts after decades of lying. Now that her campaign is broke, she's okay with SuperPAC money. Flexibility on once high-conviction values is not what you want from a politician. It's odd that folks believed they could trap the Bernie lightning in a bottle for themselves and crowd-fund a $1-$2 billion campaign, $20 at a time. You really would need every single voter to give you money! Well, Mayor Pete had the right idea, but he's kind of a self-parody in that his inexperience and staying power says more about the other candidates than it does about him. Do we know anything about him or his policies other than the obvious, that he's not crazy or 100 years old or a billionaire? Biden \"peaked early\", the cardinal sin of politics. He won't be around post-super Tuesday is my guess. I have no bars for Farallon's former CIO. RIP Gabbard, Booker, Yang and my favorite, Kamala. Man, Kamala made Warren look honest. She really dated a guy 30 years older than her for a promotion when she was a prosecutor. This is not a women to get in the way of. Or to vote for, apparently.\r\n\r\nPolitics are interesting, but ultimately fruitless and unproductive to worry about. We all care about our country and its direction. At the end of the day, however, your time is probably better spent consuming other content. Learn some skills, ignore the propaganda and pull of corporate for-profit news. Someone, somewhere in the world, will want your skills. No one wants to hear anyone drone on about politics ;)\n\n[Posted by Reida]\n\n((apparently he sent me this yesterday and I didn\u2019t see it until now\u2014whoops!\ns/o to whoever dmd and asked about politics.

The first one was when millions of Chinese were put into quarantine. The S&P500 dropped by 3% and a couple days later, achieved its ATH of 3393.52. This \"correction\" is totally absurd by itself. Nothing was priced in by this time. 3%? You telling me nobody knew about the disruption this would cause to supply chains? The info was right there for everybody that this must cause supply chain disruptions.\n\nNow, last week resulted in a -13% decline from the S&P500 ATH. It started with Apple's warning on revenue guidance and a bunch of other events. Ask yourself: Did this correction price in the current situation of the world (supply chain disruptions) **AND** impact on growth **AND** a possible widespread infection of the EU and the US?\n\nIMHO, this correction *partially* priced in supply chain disruptions, but remains basically completely ignorant of US and EU infections. The market is still priced as if:\n\n* Corona didn't arrive in the US and the EU\n* the supply chain disruption is a little -13% inconvenience and not a total clusterfuck\n* printing money in the system could fix the problem\n\ntldr: SPY puts strike 270 or lower, next two weeks. I expect at least -20% from ATH (2,714 / $270) or more. Same for DAX and other EU indexes.\n\nI already hold puts worth of \\~70K\u20ac on SPY and DAX and am considering buying more.\n\nEdit: Positions. Sorry Americans, German here, UI is in German.

I believed them, shorted EWY hard, and it took 2 hours for the news to hit bloomberg.\n\nIn the two hour interval where the stock was rising, the market was efficient, since everyone who had information was already short or at least not buying. Everyone who wanted to buy could also buy. When the news hit publicly, it was also efficient, since everyone who wanted to buy or sell had done so until market reached equilibrium.\n\n-\u2010-------------- NERD TALK BELOW ----------------\n\nThis can be expanded. When you say the market will get worse but it's already priced in. However, when information is released, the price will fall further? Why?\n\nAssuming a perfectly efficient market and perfect information estimation, the market, in the face of information, will be priced at:\n\n>S = E[dS/dt | information] = p * (E[S2 - S1]) - (1-p) * (E[S2 - S3]) - c\n\nWhere S is stock price, t is time, p is probability of your information being correct, c is the cost of acting upon the information, and S2 - S1 being the difference from price final and price initial. S3 - S2 is the difference from price final and price intial when you are wrong. (If you short and it goes up, you lose money.)\n\nWith this, you will see that even if information is perfect (p = 1), there will be a cost associated with your transaction, but the markets will efficiently find equilibrium. Read: *Limits of Arbitrage by Andrei Schleifer*\n\nIn reality, (0 < p < 1) even after information has been confirmed because you must account for people not knowing, knowing but not acting, and a chance that your information is incorrectly reported.\n\nSource: Am a quant economist but a retarded one who hangs out here.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Markets are efficient but irrational, buy puts", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "That was quite helpful, many thanks.
