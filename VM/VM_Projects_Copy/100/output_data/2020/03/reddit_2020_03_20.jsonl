For legacy players it is some balancing act between that and maintaining their current customer base. They all have to shift to taking dollars NOW vs. LATER. That is, they have to become less speculative. That favors doubling down on ICE and profitable models. Essentially it makes them more short term in scope because that's the easiest way to guarantee profits. Ford has the Mach-E and maybe they want to make dents in electric so in an ideal world they spend a lot on marketing that and keep the price lower than otherwise. They can't do that now.\n\nThere really is only one complexity here which is government interference.

Even with potential bailouts, they are in survival mode - which means we have an even greater chance of increasing Tesla's lead.\n\n\nAssuming we don't stand still, we will win. If these companies really are in a position to use the bailouts for EV research, they still have to find the best people for the job. That is a known constraint for Tesla now, so I'm guessing it'll be hard to find a lot of good people for legacy mfg.\n\n\nPlus, there's the whole battery issue also - In the mid-term, I see competition with Tesla as a bad game to play. Long-term if they haven't caught up, they are dead. It's a tough place to be in for legacy.

So let's say VW does ok, that leaves 90% of the market lagging. These companies are sitting ducks and their marketshare gets slip up among the companies that do well.\n\nMy default guess now is that in 2025 to 2030 the entire industry collapses to maybe 5 companies that each have 20%. Tesla gets there organically. The other 4 get there by acquiring other failed versions of themselves.\n\nThe reason that the auto industry has low market caps and low multiples is because they have commodity products with a lot of competition making the same basic product.

Maybe Apple buys a legacy automaker or something? They certainly have the cash to do it.
