In the example above, if tesla closes at 1210.7, the profit for the 3x cs is still 50.7, just as if it had closed at 1180. This is the break even point for the lone 1160c (1210.7 - 1160). If tesla closes at 1300, the 3x cs profit is still only 50.7, and the lone 1160c makes 140 (1300-1160). \n\nThe reason people play the spread is that there normally is an extremely small chance that tesla shoots up 9% like it did this morning.

All the technology expected to be unveiled at Battery Day in September is owned solely by Tesla. \n\n1) Tesla acquired a small super-capacitor company called Maxwell Technologies last year, because a breakthrough manufacturing technique (Dry Battery Electrode \"DBE\") developed by Maxwell for super-capacitors was theorized by Maxwell and proven by Tesla (at their Halifax Battery lab run by Jeff Dahn) to be applicable in the manufacture of lithium ion batteries, significantly lowering the cost and complexity of manufacturing by removing corrosive wet solvents from the process while also improving the energy density and life cycle.  \n\n2) At the same time, Tesla was working with another tiny company in Colorado called Sil-ion that had developed a means of using silicon in the battery cells to improve their lifespan and power density significantly, but didn't know how to manufacture the cells. These cells were being tested at the same lab in Halifax as the Maxwell process above, and there was a presentation made last fall by a researcher from the lab that briefly mentioned that the Sil-ion cell design was manufacturable using the Maxwell DBE process.  Tesla acquired Sil-ion quietly at some point in the last year. \n\n3) Tesla filed a patent for a novel cell package last year (granted this spring, look up \"tabless electrode\") which changes how cylindrical cells are manufactured to significantly decrease the amount of heat generated during use ( improving cycle life) and decreases the cost of manufacture. Right after they filed this patent, Tesla purchased a Canadian company, Hibar Systems... one of the world leaders in cylindrical battery cell manufacturing technologies. \n\nAll of these technologies individually represent huge breakthroughs in the cost and capabilities of lithium ion batteries. Combined, even if they compound diminishingly, they represent a battery product that immediately obsoletes everything else on the market, if Tesla can bring it to market.

No oil changes, nothing... just tires! Look the list goes on... Now see I don\u2019t know about you, but I do know one thing. Stocks go up, either because of Hype, and or earnings validate where it should be... but does it really matter which one of the two is pushing it??? I mean everyone is saying the stock is not worth 1100.  Well guess what, if u want one, u are paying 1100. So I guess it is! Lol! I don\u2019t understand how everyone doesn\u2019t understand that... this thread had me dying... I\u2019ve never posted on reddit my entire life, but I couldn\u2019t resist. if you don\u2019t own a Tesla stock, your probably mad u didn\u2019t buy into the \u201chype\u201d ! This company has sent astronauts to space, on a rocket, that detached and landed itself only to be used again and again and again. That\u2019s money saved. Oh and the astronauts just kicked back and enjoyed the show. His tech did the rest.. His fucking car factory had giant robots that build his car, saves money on labor especially with minimum wage just hitting 15.00 p/h today. He can\u2019t make his cars fast enough to supply the demand. This is economics 101... but with market cap, and his factory being open again, which he punked Cali to be able to operate at that. he\u2019s building factory\u2019s that legit will be in other country\u2019s as we speak, so he doesn\u2019t have to pay for shipping. I mean I think I just named over 4 ways he\u2019s saving money. The company\u2019s that do well in this world, figure out ways to save money, while increasing revenue. Example the APPL departure with intels so they can make their own chips... Look believe in it or not, some things just don\u2019t make sense on the surface... FB losing advertisement after advertisement deals this past couple weeks due to a boycott, as we speak shit. But what\u2019s happening???  FB\u2019s stock is climbing every single day!!! Look another stimulus will come, they will then follow up with an incentive to go back to work, unlike Obama just flat out extending unemployment. To where people will go back to work, and get paid to do so, and have extra money to spend. Just To put it back into the economy. Look currency means \u201cto flow\u201d so basically This means Tesla\u2019s will get purchased, this means stocks will also be purchased. Next yo, in the am the job reports will probably shock the world once again. Why?? Because let\u2019s get serious.... most people unemployed are just waiting to be cleared from state to state to return with the exception of some. They weren\u2019t fired cuz they suck at their job, they weren\u2019t fired, cuz they were under performing. They were fired because of a virus. In which Democrats decided to blow up out of proportion just to force trumps hand. If he didn\u2019t do what he did, he would be looked at like a villain, oh wait he is looked at as a villain. Well guess what he\u2019s learned from other presidents. Instead of taking care of people with out jobs, he\u2019s taking care of business so they can employ the employees they just fired, and incentivizing people to return back to work, so we don\u2019t have the same problem. And that\u2019s having people legit shrug their shoulders and say \u201cwhy go back to Work? I\u2019m making more money now!\u201d Oh and did I mention, he will win the election one way or another, even though Biden is leading him in poles lets not forget HILLARY was also leading poles. Lmfaoooo! It\u2019s because no one wants to say they will vote for trump out loud! But best believe middle America, and suburbs, want to feel safe. So this unrest is only going to help him.

Lol, because I can tell (studied physiology) that a lot of you can\u2019t afford this stock currently and are annoyed, because back in March of this year, you could have had it at 445 per share!

Water vapour is the worst greenhouse gas (google it, I know you wont believe me), which is something very little people know, so while water is recycled by the atmosphere if we artificiality put more water (say from hydrogen energy) in the faster than it can recycle it, we will probably end up with a similar warming effect. Not too mention where will you get this hydrogen from? Right now there is two choices, oil or water. I shouldn't have to stress why getting hydrogen from water is a bad idea. We already have water scarcity, as we use our water for drinking and growing crops. We do not need to have fuel taking up water that barely meets our food and drinking needs. That would be a catastrophe. Same goes for biofuels, they need massive croplands to be cleared and massive amount of water which deplete the aquifers faster than they can recharge.

Tesla purchases its battery cells from actual battery companies like LG Chem or Panasonic. The technology isn't owned wholly by Tesla.

I'm sure there's some proprietary stuff that's directed by Tesla, but within suppliers, these techs tend to flow laterally and leak into other programs. \n\nSecond, and this just might be my own bias, but the difficulty in automotive manufacture isn't the bottleneck in awesome technology. In my view, having the know-how of how to control manufacturing processes, controlling tolerances, and knowing how to control suppliers and supply chains, is the main challenge, and a lot of this was trial and error. These items increase in difficulty the more you scale up. I don't think it is as easy as \"Tesla has great technology so they will catch up any day to the big 3.\" The big 3 have a hundred years experience of fucking shit up that they won't fuck up today. Tesla will not gain this knowledge overnight. \n\nThird, I admit that Tesla has great self-driving technology, but right now GM for instance is pouring more money and investments into self driving technology than Tesla ever did.
