If my understanding is correct, the incentive of buying and selling call options is that if I buy a contract for $x strike price and the stock hits $y (which is greater than $x), I have the right, but not the obligation to buy 100 shares (1 contract) of whatever stock the option is for at price x. Similarly, if I don't execute buying those 100 shares, I can sell that contract to someone else who can then do that instead. Is that correct?\n\nIn terms of puts, I'm confused at what the incentive is here. Does it mean that purchasing a contract at a strike price of $x enables you to sell shares of that stock for value x even if the current share price of that stock is $y (which is less than $x)?\n\nAlso, how are premiums determined?

A long call is a bullish play, you are betting the stock goes up. A long put is a bearish play, you are betting the stock goes down.\n\n> Also, how are premiums determined?\n\nThey are determined by the market, like the price of stocks and ETFs. It's an auction in a market exchange, just like for stocks. However, unlike stocks and ETF's, option contracts have a limited shelf-life. That time-factor, plus being a derivative vs. the underlying asset or index, makes it possible  to model \"optimal\" prices for each contract, given inputs like the stock price, the time to expiration, the volatility, and the risk-free interest rate. Given those inputs, the price of a contract *should* be $X. The model is called the Black-Scholes model (many good articles available via google search). Since all traders are aware of these optimal prices, the market tends to follow the price predicted by the model.

It says:\n\n> This ... value is adjusted to give more weight to the relatively liquid calls with their strike prices near the current price of the underlying.\n\n> To see the calculation for the IV Index, let\u2019s use an example of \"IVX Call 30.\u201d Suppose today is\n04/05/2004, and there are 12 days until the front month (April) expires - and 47 days until the next month\nexpiration (May). Options using these two expirations will be used for the IV Index calculation of term 30 -\nas they are the 2 expirations closest to 30-day virtual expiration.\n\n> First, we take four April call options contracts with strikes nearest to current stock price to calculate IV\nIndex for April, or \"IVX Call 12\". \"IVX Call 12\" is their weighted average, where weighting is by Vega\n(option price sensitivity to a change in Implied Volatility).\nIn the same manner, the IV Index for May expiry is calculated, \"IVX Call 47\". Now, we interpolate these\ntwo values to get \"IVX Call 30\"; the interpolation is linear by square root of days to expiry, that is,\n\n> This particular interpolation is commonly used when dealing with volatilities, as it better describes the\nbehavior of volatility compared to using days to expiration interpolation. \n\n> There are several different IV Indexes with call, put, and mean values, with terms from 30 to180 days. If\none single value is chosen as the best representative value for implied volatility it would be IVX 30, since\nthey are nearest to expiration and the most liquid, making their implied volatilities the most relevant.\nHowever, using the mean between calls and puts, as a reference value, may not highlight important\ndifferences, called the skew, between calls and puts. \n\nFinally, I found it interesting that they note for the chart comparing HV to IV:\n\n> The chart section has two charts.

If delta was a percent, 50% delta of TSLA at $1600 would be $800, while 50% delta of MRNA at $84 would be $42. Or for calls, 50% delta of $22 TSLA call would be $11, while 50% delta of a $6 MRNA call would be $3.

If the goal is delta-neutral, that's achieved at the portfolio level, not the individual trade level. Well, not with a calendar anyway. \n\nYou'd have to take an offsetting position in your portfolio to net delta to zero. Professional traders do this with futures or index options, like a put on SPX, but they also use computers to constantly go in and out of hedge positions to maintain delta neutrality, since everything is constantly changing. This is not feasible for ordinary retail traders, so you either loosen up a bit and let delta vary over a range, or you use a delta neutral strategy that enforces the range for you automatically, like with an Iron Condor. What you gain in simplicity and set-and-forget, you lose in total delta hedging, because your Iron Condor can get tested if direction goes further than expected.\n\n> is the calendar spreads a bad idea in low IV environments?\n\nIMHO, I think calendars are *better suited* to low IV environments.

If I'm trying to trade no more than 5-10% of my portfolio (I know 2-5% is generally recommended), it leaves me with a smaller pool of stocks to choose from.  I typically don't choose stocks that are over $50 due to my portfolio being $50k.

But I could potentially sell far OTM put credit spreads to make a decent amount of ROI.  For example, AAPL is at $386 today.  The expected move for the Aug 21 options is $33.  To stay above a 90% chance of being OTM I was looking at choosing the 325/315 puts for a credit of about $40 while risking $1,000 for an AROI if both expire OTM of 64%.  \n\nI recognize there is a significant risk with a relatively small reward, however I have confidence both strikes will expire OTM.

I'm running similar put credit spreads right now, although I'm at 30 delta, rather than the 10 delta you need for 90% PoP.\n\nAnother cost effective strategy you could consider is credit calendar spreads or credit diagonals. A diagonal is great if you have high conviction on a bullish or bearish target, like LOW 160 on the bullish side. If you want to have a long call on LOW more than 60 days to expiration, but can't afford the sky high premium, you can write 90% PoP short calls on a weekly or monthly basis, collect relatively safe credit on a regular basis, and subsidize the cost of the long call.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, I am running the wheel on my CSPs if I get assigned.

Both spreads are  bullish positions, but a debit spread is probably more bullish because to achieve maximum profit the stock most move above the short call.\n\nCall debit requires that you put money up first, and then realize maximum profits when the stock price moves above the short call. To enter a debit spread you buy a call and sell call with the same expiration dates but different strike prices. Your max loss is the difference between the premiums spent on purchasing the long call and selling the short call. Your max profit is the spread between the two strike prices minus what you put up to buy the long call. You buy a 80 call for 3, sell a 85 call with the same expiration date for 2, for a difference of 1($100 your max loss) if the stock moves above 85 both contacts will be assigned allowing you to buy 100 shares for 85 and sell 100 shares for 90, resulting in $500 minus the 100 you already spent for a maximum profit of 400.\n\nA put credit spread allows you to make money first, and then assume the risk after. To enter a put credit spread you buy a put and then sell a put with a higher strike price. You're maximum profit is the difference between the two strike prices. You buy a put at 80 for 1, and then sell a put at 85 with the same expiration date and collect a premium of 3 giving you a max profit of 2($200). Your maximum loss in this scenario would be 300, the difference between the strike prices and premium collected. \n\nIn a neutral/bullish position a put credit spread would appear to be the better option because you don't need the stock to move very much to make a profit, it just can't go down.

That doesn't help someone new understand the concept. \n\nThese \"options\" are literal contracts that give the purchaser of the contract the right but not the obligation to buy or sale a stock at an agreed upon price. And not just a single share but 100 shares. That's just the way the contract is written. If I own 100 shares of Microsoft I can write and sell a contract that says I will give you any gains if the stock goes up. Why would I do that? Well, if I don't think the stock will go up but I still want to make a little off my investment then I write and sell a contract. I'm selling you the right to buy my Microsoft shares at an agreed upon price. And you give me a small amount of money (called the premium) to have the option to buy my Microsoft shares. \n\nA real world analogy could be a real estate investor purchasing a contract that gives him the right to buy in a certain neighborhood. He may pay $5k for the right to buy but he still doesn't have to. And the contract has an expiration date. He won't have the right forever. If housing prices go up then he gets to buy at the previous value and has instant equity. If prices go down he technically could still buy at that price but that wouldn't be very smart. It would be better to just let the contract expire and buy a house at market price. \n\nThat is a CALL option. You have the right to buy someone else's shares at an agreed price before the expiration date. \n\nOn the flip side a PUT is the right to sell and push a stock to someone else which forces them to buy. If I have a bunch of cash and I want to buy a stock but I think the price is too high then I can sell you a contract and I will agree to buy your shares if the stock drops to an agreed price. If it drops even further then I will technically be taking a loss. \n\nThe idea behind options is to manage risk. The person selling options is selling risk. The person buying options is buying risk. We don't know what the future will bring. Some people are more or less risk averse. \n\n\nBob is very risk averse so he is willing to give up some of his \"potential\" large gains in return for a guaranteed small gain. He is happy to have more certainty and the buyer of his call option is happy to take on more risk with the potential for a higher return. \n\nSandy also risk averse and doesn't want to buy a stock just to have it's value go down the next day. She also doesn't want her cash to just sit around and not earn anything. She is happy to earn a guaranteed small return by selling PUT options and if the stock falls and she is forced to buy then she is happy she got the stock she already wanted at a cheaper price. \n\nJim moves 100k of his investment into SPY and to hedge his investment he spends $500 buying SPY PUTs. He is using a PUT like a home owner uses insurance. You don't want your house to burn down but if it does you get a check to help cover the costs.

You cannot buy options on margin) So, unless you are stupid enough to bet years of profits on a single option trade, you cannot get wiped out in a single trade\n\nSELLING options? Different story. If you're SELLING options you can lose much more than you started with and wipe yourself out with one bad trade but you should only be selling options if you're experienced/are knowledable \n\nI made over 40k (Canadian dollars) selling options. I literally made 25k in 4 trading weeks recently (only because I was taking massive amounts of risk, getting returns like that selling puts is unheard of. I thought I was being smart, I was gambling) I was super upset I missed the march bottom and was revenge trading... broke rule number one, leave emotion out of it.\n\n I lost it all AND more in one week because I opened up wayyy too many put spreads ALL in the tech sector. When you sell a put, you instantly are paid a \"premium\", it is added to you cash balance instantly. if the stock stays above the puts price, you get to keep that full premium. So, selling puts on tech stocks were like free money to me and I got blinded by greed. I was not even calculating how much I would lose, just how much profit I would make... If the stock price falls below the put, you get assigned the shares at the price you sold the put for BUT I was selling put SPREADS. And, if lose on those, you lose. You do not get to keep any stock and just hold to make back your gains\n\nSo, yeah. Selling options is much more consistent money than buying options, which, can be almost like straight up gambling. Selling options is a great way to increase gains as long as you do not take on too much risk at a time and hedge yourself/do not sell spreads unless you can afford to take assignment of the stock.

When rates are low it's cheap to borrow money so people buy homes, companies borrow cash to reinvest in their businesses, and the economy grows. \n\nThe Fed also prints money but the thing a lot of people don't understand is that the amount of money printed isn't pre-determined by the Fed. When you go get a mortgage at the bank, they aren't necessarily lending you money from other people's deposits or money that the bank has, they're creating the money to lend you through manipulating their balance sheet. This means that money shows up in an account out of thin air. If that money goes into circulation it can cause inflation. When rates are low, more money gets created.\n\nIn general the Fed wants to cut rates when the economy is in trouble because low rates stimulate economic activity. Raising rates has the opposite effect, it lowers economic activity, reins in inflation, and causes businesses and individuals to lower expenses in general which can lead to rises in unemployment and lower production capability.\n\nDuring the past decade of bull markets rates never went up. So now that shit hit the fan the fed has to simulate cutting rates by pumping cash into the economy, which is called \"quantitative easing\" or more commonly abbreviated to QE. This is why the market can do well despite most of the economy \"shutting off\" during the pandemic. The problem is that if we start to see inflation go out of control, the fed will have to stop QE and potentially raise rates even if they know it will cause major economic problems for years to come. Because the effects of hyperinflation are even worse than another recession/depression. \n\nSo basically what I'm saying is that anyone can say \"the fed has no reason to raise rates\" because it's obviously true that they don't want to. But if inflation forces their hand it ceases to matter that it's an inconvenient time to raise rates because there is an imminent threat of hyperinflation. But it's not an exact science to predict inflation.
