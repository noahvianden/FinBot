The main risk is that market sentiment may turn negative ahead of the ER, perhaps to an exaggerated extent. The inflated IV gives you some cushion, but since your delta is probably much larger than your vega, a drop in price will probably hurt you more. This also illustrates the importance of understanding greeks and how they impact premium.\n\nAs for MSFT, don't concern yourself with the calculated break even point, that only applies at expiration. All that matters is that the contract you hold increases in value, likely due to MSFT going up from the point when you opened the contract (thus the importance of knowing that quote to compare to the current quote). If MSFT goes up from 202 to 203 and your delta is 20, you'll gain $0.20 in premium, never mind break even.

It may payoff off if you do a consecutive series of trades, say monthly, for the next few years. How they are structured is up to you. Might be the same strike, might be different strikes, might have varying expirations. You might go with LEAPs, or stick with 30-60 DTE. The point is, you're trying to capture a long term uptrend in the most efficient way you can design, so that *on average* you exploit the trend for profit.

I need help from people who are smarter and more experienced with options than I am to figure out what I'm missing.\n\nIn poker, we have something called *pot odds*. For those who aren't familiar, if it costs us $1 to call for a chance to win a $2 pot, then our pot odds are 2-to-1. If we have the best hand more than 33% of the time, then calling $1 for a chance to win $2 is a net positive expectation play; conversely, we should fold anything with a less-than-33% chance of winning.\n\nApplying similar logic to options - suppose I'm scanning for opportunities to sell bull put spreads. I know the max P/L based on the premiums collected and paid and the distance between the strikes, and I calculate ROI by taking net credit as a percent of capital at risk. With risk and ROI defined, I calculate the *options equivalent of pot odds* (i.e. how often the play has to go in my favor in order to be a net positive expectation play). Assuming I can use delta as a proxy for an option contract's probability of expiring ITM (hence, I can subtract delta from 1 to estimate the probability that the spread expires worthless), if I want to take a purely mathematical approach to scanning for net positive expectation plays, all I need to do is filter where the probability that the short put expires OTM is greater than pot odds.\n\nMethod:\n\n1.\tDownload the latest quote data from [CBOE](http://www.cboe.com/delayedquote/quote-table-download).\n2.\tImport into [Google spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BSDyt7wxE_suMna4dP4v7obosnJRAD0kEJtqDIzPwMI/edit?usp=sharing).\n3.\tCalculate Net credit, Capital at risk, ROI, Pot odds, Prob OTM, and filter on the options where Prob OTM > Pot odds.\n\nBased on the data from CBOE, an example of a net positive expectation play would be selling the 330/329 put spread that expires 8/3 because probability that the short put expires out of the money is 33.7%, which is greater than the pot odds of 29% (click the \"Filter views\" menu in the top left corner to the right of the Print icon, and then select \"Positive Expectation\"). Another example is the 365/360 put spread that expires 8/3 because the probability that the short put expires OTM is 12%, which is greater than the pot odds of 6.8%.\n\nAside from being scared of the thought of selling the 8/3 365p while the underlying trades at 326, if I can get past my emotions and trust the math, then it should be a positive expectation play.\n\nWhat else am I missing here?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would like to try and answer this question too.

If expiration was Friday, you might be able to trade Monday, or you might have to wait until Tuesday, depending.\n\n> I get to keep the Delta between the strike price and market price of when it sells?\n\nThis is confusing, because \"delta\" is a reserved word in options terminology. It doesn't mean \"difference\" in the way you intended.\n\nBut even if we replace \"delta\" with \"difference\", the statement is still not correct. You bought shares at the strike price. What profit or loss you obtain from that trade depends entirely on the market. Like you said, the market could gap down 50% on Monday morning.\n\nJust think of the premium as added on to the basis of the stock. So if you paid $10 for the call and exercised at $100, you need to sell the shares at $110 to break even. That's what that \"break even\" number is, that's quoted on your call contract. If you were $125 ITM, you have an unrealized $15 gain at the time of exercise.\n\n> Are brokers OK with this as long as you settle your negative balance on Monday? \n\nBrokers are never \"okay\" with a negative balance, but they understand you may need time to scrape together the cash, thus the [T+2 settlement rule](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/stock-settlement-why-you-need-to-understand-t2-timeline). In a cash account, you can never sell the shares to settle the cost of the shares, broker's are wise to that scam. It even has a name: freeriding. You need to come up with the cash before T+2 if you want to sell the shares. In a margin account, as noted above, you have more flexibility -- you can take out a margin loan, for example -- but there is still a good-faith holding period.

Google had years of experience solving for hyper scale challenges where traditional or conventional methods would not work.  The problem is not all enterprise customers had that level of scale challenges and Google's method made migration to GCP more challenging.\n\nFor example, VMware virtual machines was the prevalent technology when AWS introduced EC2 (AWS virtual machine services) back in 2006.  People understood virtual machines.  Adoption and migration  was made easier when going to AWS EC2 instances from VMware.\n\nGoogle on the other hand thought containers was the better technology (I happen to agree) and thought enterprise customers should use containers instead of virtual machines.  The problem was most customers were not familiar with containers until more recently.  Google didn't even introduce Google Compute Engine (virtual machines) until 2012, 6 years after AWS EC2 was introduced.   And I've heard, GCE is a virtual machine running on containers.  Google was too far ahead of it's time.  However, GCP has gotten a little better in recent years about releasing products based on what the customers want.\n\nAWS on the other hand have been releasing products and services left and right based on what they hear from their customers.  A little too aggressive sometimes where they are releasing products/services before they are ready for prime time.\n\nEven though Microsoft got a bit of a late start with Azure, Microsoft has been working with enterprise customers for a very long time and probably have the best understanding of what's important to enterprise customers.
