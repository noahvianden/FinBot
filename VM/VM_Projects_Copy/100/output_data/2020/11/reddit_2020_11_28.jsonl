{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n> \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n> \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.\n*****\n> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n> # Jobs report\n> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n> \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n> \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n> \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n> \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n> In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into \u201921, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn\u2019t only about the US anymore.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-12-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-13-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Earnings are expected to see a major bounce back, as the global economy gets back online next year, making many investors quite thankful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-14-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Economic forecasts may not develop as predicted.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful?

{"title": "QuantumScape ($QS) EV growth potential with boomer backing", "selftext": "QuantumScape is a US EV battery developer that just started trading on NYSE yesterday.\n\n**Technology**\n\nQuantumScape was founded in 2010 by Jagdeep Singh who is also the founder of Infinera which is anorther high tech start-up company.\n\nThey are developing solid-state lithium batteries relying on a solid material known as \"solid-state electrolyte\", whereas conventional batteries rely on liquid or gel electrolytes. Solid-state electrolytes allow for a much higher energy density, resulting in a longer range and more importantly in faster-charge times of about 15 minutes.  Since 2010 they spent over 300 Million $ in the development of this technology.\n\nTheir battery technology promises:\n\n* A range of over 300 miles\n* Charging in under 15 minutes\n* Costs per car under 30K$\n* A Battery Lifetime of more than 12 years or over 150,000 miles\n* More safety due to the non-oxidizable solid-state technology\n\nThe fact, that lithium-ion batteries didnt improve their engery density since 2015 is in my point of view the biggest plus. They secured their advancements with over 200 existing and pending patents.\n\n**Financials**\n\nOf course QuantumScape isnt profitable yet, and they dont plan to be cash flow positive until 2027.\n\nThey accumulated a deficit over the years of about 256 Million $ leading to a negative equity. But accumulated deficit/ accumulated profit is as all of us a know a pure accounting figure with no actual cash outflows. The massive pile of retained losses is due to their constant R&D spendings, hopefully resulting in true technological advancements.\n\nQuantumScape has enough cash at hand to repay their non-current liabilites and 3 times the amount of their current liabilities. Additionally, no additional debt financing is planned as they expect to generate 1 billion $ through their NYSE listing through the SPAC Kensington Capital Aquisitions (230 million $ funding, management and board  stacked with  automotive and technology experts).\n\nBased on a forward looking revenue growth modell (20% discount rate) QuantumScape is valued at 3,3 billion $, whilst the current market cap is around 560 milion\n\n**Backing**\n\nQuantomScope is backed by a lot of expierenced decision makers like JB Straubel from Tesla but also with a load of inovative investors. In 2020 the Volkswagen Group announced its plans to increase shareholding in QuantumScape. Volkswagen sees the future in solid-state batteries rather than lithium-ion batteries as they started cooperating with QuantumScape in 2012. QuantumScape and VW established a joint-venture together to equip all VW EVs. VW is currently producing around 11 million cars per year and has plans to launch 70 electric vehicle models by 2029 with an additional spending of 38 billion $ in eletric mobility by 2024.\n\nAdditional investors are Continental, Bill Gates and Breakthrough Energy which is a umbrella for several organizations that are bundling efforts to accelerate innovation in sustainable energy. Members are Jeff Bezoss, Jack Ma, Richard Branson and George Soros among others.\n\nQuantumScope started trading on friday with a gain of roughly 60%. It is expected that many investors are jumping on the boat till the end of the year.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-battery-developer-quantum-scape-begins-trading-on-nyse-153744553.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-battery-developer-quantum-scape-begins-trading-on-nyse-153744553.html)\n\n[https://s26.q4cdn.com/263384136/files/doc\\_presentation/QuantumScape-Analyst-Presentation-Oct2020.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/263384136/files/doc_presentation/QuantumScape-Analyst-Presentation-Oct2020.pdf)\n\n[https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/quantumscape-diese-firma-soll-den-durchbruch-fuer-deutsche-e-autos-bringen-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000174211442](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/quantumscape-diese-firma-soll-den-durchbruch-fuer-deutsche-e-autos-bringen-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000174211442)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/bill-gates-backed-ev-battery-supplier-to-go-public-through-spac-deal.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/bill-gates-backed-ev-battery-supplier-to-go-public-through-spac-deal.html)\n\n[https://www.quantumscape.com/team/](https://www.quantumscape.com/team/)\n\n[https://electrek.co/2020/11/27/battery-startup-backed-vw-tesla-co-founder-jb-straubel-quantumscape-qs-public/](https://electrek.co/2020/11/27/battery-startup-backed-vw-tesla-co-founder-jb-straubel-quantumscape-qs-public/)\n\n**Positions**:  None unfortunately, I was too fucking slow.", "id": "k2nz8g", "created_utc": 1606571515.0, "score": 131, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "It already popped 60%...", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Citronnnnn!", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10426675528287888}, {"body": "It already popped 60%...", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "My comment aged like milk", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "It already popped 60%", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20960144698619843}, {"body": "Like a  fine wine.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36882907152175903}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1855672299861908}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22343960404396057}, {"body": "Microvast / Tuscan Holdings already have $100M in revenue with batteries and its sat just over $12 lol", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "I think the main drag is doubt on if/when the merger goes through, since it hasn't been finalized yet.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Will find out early dec on an agreement, if not itll just be pushed to April.

The market pull-back risk tends to be ignored when thinking about these kinds of plays, but it's something to consider if you want to survive long-term as a trader.

I have tried selling credit spreads and was doing well, but I took one L and that was the end of that. What is your criteria, I would love to learn?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "21 day EMA as your mean. If the stock is trending up or down, wait until it pulls back to the 21-day EMA, wait for confirmation that it's moving back, I usually wait for it to finish at a price above/below the pullback and then sell a call or put spread at the mean or farther out at a line of resistance/support. I start at the 30 delta, if I can go farther and still get 33% credit against strike width I will for more cushion. My personal trading setup rules are I won't sell at less than 33% credit. I close at 50% profit or 50% loss if within 10 days of expiration. I usually go 45 days out for expiration when opening. I try to stack positions so I have a set of spreads expiring each month. If the stock is sideways and not trending, I find a good area of support and sell at or below it for put spreads, same criteria for profit and exit.\n\nFor the month of November, I had 30 trades and an 86% win rate. Sat out the first week and a half due to uncertainty around the election and none of my setups presented themselves. That's much better than I ever did with CSP's. October was 48 trades and an 82% win rate.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with CSP's, and it's true that Theta is a greater advantage on a naked sold position than a credit spread but they are both positive theta plays. After doing CSP's for about 6 months I moved away from them for 3 reasons:\n\n1. My biggest drawdowns came from CSP's going against me.\n2. They tie up a large amount of capital for extended periods of time limiting how many positions I can open. I trade based on probabilities so the law of large numbers works in my favor only if I can trade a lot of smaller positions.\n3. The P/L vs Risk is far greater with spreads. Say you sell a CSP on a $40 stock for $100 credit (just making up numbers). That's $100 credit / $4,000 of risk which is 2.5%. 2.5% is a pretty typical % for a CSP unless you're selling more risky stocks that take you up into the 4%-6% range but people on this forum will bash you for doing that too. On that same stock, if I can get $33 per $100 strike width at the .30 delta, then sell 5 contracts that's $165 credit for $335 risked. That's a 49% P/L vs Risk compared to a 2.5%. For more credit, $165 vs $100, on the same stock at the same strike I would've sold a CSP on. And it's a risk defined strategy compared to unlimited, to $0 since it can\u2019t go below that, downside risk on a CSP if the market tanks.\n\nIf CSP's are working for you or anyone else reading this, that's great.

Don't worry, I did that with NIO.\n\nI took this as an opportunity to walk away with profits, let it cool off and find other prospects. Don't worry I bought a few shares when it was low before I went. What I found was NNDM.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nWhat do they do?\n\nTo introduce them and what they do i'll link you this video\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFaWb0aUjPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFaWb0aUjPk)\n\nIf you're too lazy to watch it, they are the first to make 3D printers which can produce electronics. Not a difficult concept to wrap your head around. They're on track to revolutionize the manufacturing process for electronics.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nDemand:\n\nTheir product is another company's capital. They make it easier and faster for other companies to make money so there will always be demand for their products. From big corporations at that. They have already worked with the US army, and leading PCB Technology companies.\n\nSources: [https://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/itar-registration-granted-certifying-clearance-to-work-in-conjunction-with-u.s.-military](https://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/itar-registration-granted-certifying-clearance-to-work-in-conjunction-with-u.s.-military)\n\n[https://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/nano-dimension-strengthens-its-position-in-the-u.s.-by-selling-an-additional-dragonfly-3d-printer-to-the-u.s.-armed-forces](https://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/nano-dimension-strengthens-its-position-in-the-u.s.-by-selling-an-additional-dragonfly-3d-printer-to-the-u.s.-armed-forces)\n\n[https://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/nano-dimension-adds-a-top-10-global-pcb-manufacturer-to-its-growing-list-of-customers](https://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/nano-dimension-adds-a-top-10-global-pcb-manufacturer-to-its-growing-list-of-customers)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nThey customer base extends from big corporations in need of capital. NNDM technologies also benefit educational institutions. Yeah it's nice for the youth of the world to learn more about technology but lets be honest. Colleges are the biggest scams in America, they have money to spend from squeezing 50k+ from every single one of their students. When this company starts running, colleges are gonna want in on the action.\n\nThey have already sold one of their printers to a University in Hong Kong\n\nSource:[https://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/nano-dimension-sells-dragonfly-ldm-additive-manufacturing-system-to-cas-cityu-joint-lab-on-robotics](https://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/nano-dimension-sells-dragonfly-ldm-additive-manufacturing-system-to-cas-cityu-joint-lab-on-robotics)\n\nAdded note: They have customers all around the world.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nInvestors:\n\nI'm not just one retard trying to sell this company to other retards. Big name investors see their potential too.\n\nCathy Woods (Who invested in Tesla before they were big) Chief investor of ARK Invest has been consistently buying large sums of shares during the following weeks. It holds the 23rd position in their ARKQ ETF among other big names like Tesla and Apple.\n\nSource: [https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK\\_AUTONOMOUS\\_TECHNOLOGY\\_&\\_ROBOTICS\\_ETF\\_ARKQ\\_HOLDINGS.pdf](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_AUTONOMOUS_TECHNOLOGY_&_ROBOTICS_ETF_ARKQ_HOLDINGS.pdf)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nFinances:\n\nThis is the ugly side of things. This company is not YET profitable, and probably wont be for a while. 3D printers are expensive. HOWEVER, as stated, big name investors are putting money into them to keep them alive and growing.\n\nWhile they're not profitable, they have cash and utilize financial instruments to their advantage.\n\nThey have used direct offerings to steadily give investors opportunities to support their business and eat up more shares of their company. The last direct offering dropped the stock's price down significantly which is understandable because they offered the shares at $4. However, it did not take long for the stock's price to sky rocket shortly after big name investors bought up those shares. This is predicted to happen again. It has plenty of room to run until then. and if you're following the ticker, you'll be able to capitalize on the next direct offering and grab shares at a huge discount.\n\nThe price usually goes up after a direct offering.\n\nNano Dimensions isn't profitable but have plenty of investors who believe in them to support them until they are.\n\nSources: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIXR0\\_yx4U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIXR0_yx4U)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/20/2130670/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Prices-100-Million-Registered-Direct-Offering.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/20/2130670/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Prices-100-Million-Registered-Direct-Offering.html)\n\nWARNING: THE PRICE WILL DIP ONCE THE DIRECT OFFERING HAPPENS. This is HEALTHY for the stock and will help it grow. It's not expected to happen for a month but NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHEN.

At the price that I have my shares at and how much the price has rose since then which was not a large amount of time, I\u2019m confident that I bought low enough for a short or long term play. I wont say that I guarantee it\u2019s a good short term play at the price that it is now, however it may be a good plan to buy some shares now as the play will be there either short or long term, if it dips you double down if it doesn\u2019t then it\u2019s money in the bank, only way to miss out on the gains is to not be apart or to buy too high which I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too high for the longterm move so even if the short term doesnt work out like it\u2019s showing to, it\u2019s still pretty low risk. The risk level is low enough compared to the potential rise in price that to me it\u2019s a no brainer for anyone, the only thing to decide is the degree in which you\u2019re willing to invest, in my case it is a lower percentage of my market value than it couldve been which means I\u2019m missing out of a lot of money with how much it\u2019s grown since I bought not very long ago, however I\u2019m content in the prospects of my short or long term play in this either way, I dont see why a large growth in price in a short period would give any indications that it wouldnt be a good longterm play when the price is still valued pretty realistically.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "im in long for this one. i can see it being 15 to 60 in the next year or so but 8/9 close at the end of the year.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41008374094963074}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3328443169593811}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2056513875722885}, {"body": "Like today", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08034468442201614}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09137701988220215}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4306332767009735}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6638873815536499}, {"body": "I gotchu bro.
