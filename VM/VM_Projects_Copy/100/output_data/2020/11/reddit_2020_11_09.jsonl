I have a question about the Tesla Semi. \n\nDoes Tesla have plans to install charging infrastructure for the Semi in order to free up regular superchargers for cars? I heard that it takes 4 superchargers connected together to charge 1 semi. \n\nMy next question, I heard that there is a significant amount of electricity required for charging multiple semi's at the the same time, so grids will not be able to provide sufficient power for these requirements. Is this true? I know that charging will generally be done overnight when the trucks aren't in use, but for long haul journeys this won't be possible. Thanks", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "We haven't had a lot of clarity on what Tesla will do for semi supercharges. It seems likely that Semis will need a new dedicated solution due to physical space and power requirements. My suspicion is that the first customers will be using semi's for local distribution where they can all charge at one location (possibly owner owned, possibly at lower charge rates / overnight). Then the eventual semi supercharger rollout will occur as long-distance customers need them.\n\nRegarding the grid - this is a huge potential hurdle, but not inherently unsolvable. There isn't a major issue with generation capacity, but what is an issue is primarily distribution capacity, and secondarily how well the grid can handle ramp rates. It becomes even more of an issue if Tesla semi's start to travel in FSD-enabled \"trains\" with multiple semi's arriving and needing a charge simultaneously.\n\nSolving distribution capacity requires locating semi supercharges near major transmission lines, and/or installing major transmission infrastructure including transformers, cabling, etc. Consider that an average house has a peak demand of 10-20 kW (the peak demand for a neighbourhood will be somewhat lower because not everyone will turn on their heat and microwave at exactly the same time). Whereas supercharging a single semi will likely take 1 MW to keep timeline reasonable. A semi-supercharger with 25 stalls = 25 MW peak rate, and will regularly be ramping by +/- 5 MW within 10 minute increments as multiple vehicles start/finish charging. This is like switching entire neighbourhoods on and off every 10 minutes.\n\nBasically this is all to say that Tesla has its work cut out for it, but they have a team of very smart engineers and I believe they can do it. Knowing Tesla they will also leverage their vertical integration to solve this problem in ways other companies may not be able to - e.g. onsite battery storage to manage ramp rates, VPPs incorporating real-time ETA's of semi's and their battery states to minimize energy costs, and more. \n\nAs an investor I am confident Tesla has the technical acumen to solve these problems.

Particularly for stocks that pay big dividends. You open a carefully selected short call before a dividend ex div date, so your short call benefits from the ex div adjustment down of the stock price. You don't lose any money on the stock decline, though, because you got the dividend. However, nearly all of this difference is priced into the options, so it's not like it is magic free money. It more like the income is more predictable, because the CC is more likely to be successful.\n\nYou have be careful about the strike selection because of early assignment risk for short calls around an ex div date. If the cost of exercising the call is low enough, it becomes worth early exercise to get the fat dividend.\n\n> Because if the stocks trading towards the upper region of the range, maybe even naked calls would be better?\n\nNo. In a normal market, a stock at the upper end of a range-bound band is more likely to break out to the upside than go down. This market, of course, it's anyone's guess, but for most of 2010 through 2019, the safest bet would be that the stock would go up.

If we are talking about right now today, it doesn't matter if it is above or below $2, all that matters is if IDEX went up or down. The above/below $2 really only matters at expiration, which is over a year away, so who cares?\n\nA covered call is different. It makes money as the stocks goes up, but that gain is capped at the strike price of the call. So any amount IDEX goes up above $2 is canceled out by the short call losing about the same amount of money.

But if the market price rises, both options expire worthless and you only lose the cost of the original put option.\n\nI'm sure you know all about this so maybe there's another name for it. There was also some discussion of credit call and credit put spreads. These all seem like really good ideas that involve buying and selling an option at the same time. But my question was, if you do that and the option you sold gets exercised, for example you have to sell 100 shares at lower than market price, but you have a call option that allows you to buy those shares at an even lower price: do you have to buy those 100 shares out of pocket first, or can you essentially do the sell transaction and the buy transaction at the same time so you don't need to have the money in the bank?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> loophole trade is when you buy a lower-price call option and sell a higher-price call option at the exact same time. \n\nThis is a \"vertical (bullish) call debit spread\".  \n\nLoophole trade is non-standard terminology, and the person stating this is trying to confuse readers to rely on them as if a guru.\n\nIf a vertical call debit spread has the short call exercised, that is a win.  \nExercise the long call, and move onward to the next trade.\n\nPlease read the **Getting Started** section of links at the top of this weekly thread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ah okay, thank you!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09320183098316193}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8375370502471924}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38086196780204773}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7388599514961243}, {"body": "Before I get to your answers, some advice. In order of most likely to result in your success to least:\n\n1. Don't trade options until you've learned how to trade stock. Having at least 20 completed stock trades would be a good prerequisite to even considering options.\n\n1. If you insist on starting with options, do at least one month of self-study and learning, including paper trading, of stocks, AND THEN another month of self-study and paper trading of options, before attempting to trade options with real money. When I was at your stage, I was told that it takes 10k trades before you can consider yourself competent. Now that I've been trading for 11 months and over 400 completed trades, I think that 10k number is an under-estimate.\n\n1. If you decide to short-change the study period and jump in the deep end anyway, limit your total exposure. Don't yolo your entire bankroll in one trade. Keep each trade to 5% of total account value.\n\nNow, to your questions. Note that most of them are answered in the reference material at the top of the page. Begin with **Getting started** and work your way down.\n\nThat guide isn't bad. I'll add it to the wiki for this sub. Just understand that it spends about half a page on subjects that really need an entire book's worth of learning and experience to fully understand.\n\n> If I haven't invested in the stock market at all before, is it bad to start with options? Should I invest in traditional stocks first?\n\nAlready answered above.\n\n> How much money should I reasonably have to begin investing? ($500? $1000? More than that?)\n\n$1000 is a bare minimum and your degrees of freedom to pursue current opportunities is extremely limited. Opportunities come with different sizes and different time windows, so the more money you have, the more opportunities for profit become available.\n\n$5000 is a bit more comfortable and lets you diversify into more trades at once.\n\n$30k is when things really open up, including day trading in a margin account.\n\n> What is a normal rate of return in say the first month of trading options? \n\nNegative. Expect to lose up to 50% of your starting bankroll in your first year. This is not an exaggeration. Mistakes are costly, and you'll make lots of mistakes. It's inevitable, if you jump in without the training and prep outlined above.\n\nIf you end up winning big, don't kid yourself, you got lucky.\n\nAfter you get to an adequate level of competency, something between 2% and 5% as an annual average (CAGR) is an achievable goal. Some traders using credit strategies can get that up to over 10%, but they've been doing this for a long time. Those return rates are based on backtesting, for example:\n\nhttps://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-strategy-performance/\n\n> Stupid question but if you do a loophole trade, and you close both the options at the same time (the one you sold and the one you bought) does that mean you need to have the cash to buy the stocks? Or would you get the money from one option to pay for the other?\n\n\"Loophole\" is slang that author came up with. It is nonstandard and no on one this sub will know what you are talking about. \n\nThe standard term is a vertical spread. The \"loophole\" is a debit spread, and \"reverse loophole\" is a credit spread. Start using the standard terms ASAP.\n\nThere is no exercise involved in closing a debit spread. If you close it for a profit, you don't need anything, you get cash. If you close it for a loss, you'll lose cash. You are right, when you close a debit spread, the net effect is that the cash from selling-to-close the long leg defrays the cost of buying-to-close the short leg. But you don't trade the legs individually, you open and close the spread as a whole.\n\n> I'd like to start out with paper trading on TDAmeritrade because I have a coworker who recommended it.

Some get random tips from wsb and their Uber driver.\n\nAll the greeks are important. As a very quick explainer, here's what I do when considering a long call or long put trade:\n\n* Is the contract/option chain liquid? I need to see at least 100 volume ATM after 1 hour of trading that day. That can tail off further from ATM, but never lower than 10. Is the bid/ask decent? 1.03/1.07 would be fine, but 1.03/2.07 would not be -- in general, I want the bid/ask to be no more than 2x the ATM bid/ask spread, and that should not be more than 10% of the bid.\n\n* Since I trade 30-45 DTE, is the 1 month/1 day candle chart showing that the stock is undervalued but on a rising trend (value), or is it overvalued and on an accelerating rising trend (momentum)? Where is the cross-over with the 200 candle SMA? That's the bullish approach. Invert for the bearish approach.\n\n* Is there an event, like a dividend or earnings report, during the projected hold time? I avoid those.\n\n* And last but not least, do I have a theory on why the contract should increase in value? Is it an industry that's set to break-out to the downside any day now, like biopharma? Or already at the beginning of a down trend, like gold? How strong is my conviction in that theory? Is it based on facts or hope? Hope is not a strategy.\n\n\nMoneyness/delta selection depends on all of the above. If my conviction is low, I might want to go a bit ITM to get some insurance. If my conviction is high, I'll go OTM to get some leverage without giving up too much upside potential.\n\nTime as days to expiration is all about theta and conviction. If I'm sure of the direction but unsure of the timing, I want more time in expiration to be right. Further expirations have less theta decay for the same hold time, say 10 days from open.\n\nWhat is IV on the contract? Is it over 30? That's high and I can expect some IV crush risk. Is it less than 20? I might get the benefit of some IV inflation then.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48059114813804626}, {"body": "What happens with *early assignment of ITM covered calls*?

After educating myself, I have found more success now and man the stress level is so much lower when employing the right strategy and not overleveraging.  If you are just getting started, I'd highly recommend losing the visions of grandeur some come to options with (if you have them) and realize that if you try to play options like a casino, you are going to lose.
