Always interesting to read the opposite view to what I hold. Your part about Mobileye in particular I agree with - I think similar to other car parts self-driving will be commoditised and produced by 3rd parties rather than in-house. I'm less certain that Mobileye will retain an industry lead in lvl5 autonomy than you - lvl2 and lvl5 are very different and it's difficult to tell who'll win imo.\n\nAs for the other parts, I don't agree with as much, and here's why.\n\n1.Tiger Lake. The benchmarks chosen are rather odd. While Tiger Lake does seem to be competitive and will claw back market share if Intel can produce in large quantities (which another commenter claims they can't), the performance uplift is nowhere near as much as they claim - all the benchmarks are cherry picked and presented in a manipulated way (I can explain more if you're interested, but yeah, wait for independents).\n\n2. The 'data-centric' vs 'PC-centric' is a misnomer in my opinion. Intel should report 'x86' and 'other' segments. Xeons are ultimately built on the same fundamentals as their PC parts, and underperformance in PC is a leading indicator of underperformance in datacentre CPUs. I explained [here](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm) a few weeks ago why Intel's datacentre CPUs will, in my opinion, never be competitive with AMD on 10nm, and Tiger Lake's performance does nothing to change my argument.\n\n3. Edge computing is definitely very interesting, and likely to expand the 'pie' of servers quite significantly. I agree with your analysis that it even a marginal percentage of the market will be significant for Intel, but I doubt their Xe graphics will be able to make any impact. Nvidia's software stack is an incredibly strong moat, and CUDA is going to keep Intel firmly out.\n\nI'd be interested on your views on mine/my post", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, thanks so much for reading and providing such a thorough set of feedback. I checked out your post, and to be totally honest, I\u2019d be doing you a disservice if I claimed I could speak to the manufacturing processes with as much detail as you did in your piece. That was simply beyond the scope of my research. While I do recognize that manufacturing is an important part of the story, having worked in a manufacturing intensive industry I can definitely say that it\u2019s impossible to know what steps are being taken internally to address these issues and how effective they are. \n\nI always am wary when the main value-added of a particular business model is supposedly the manufacturing process. There is nothing proprietary about a manufacturing process and nothing to stop a competitor from adopting the same approach to enhance their product production. If you are correct that the consensus is signaling one way to produce, I don\u2019t see a reason why Intel with the same level of in-house engineering/purchasing talent wouldn\u2019t be able to resolve these issues. Not saying that happens overnight, but this is a long-term piece and I think the market/analysts are overly focused on the immediate term. \n\nAs for Mobileye, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s entirely true about L2 to L5. The latest Tesla Computer and EyeQ 5 both support L5 but are being used for 2+/3 capabilities. The real prohibitor in having L5 today is a combination of the overall hardware for full autonomy costing $10-15k and being too expensive to adapt to a consumer vehicle; 2) regulatory frameworks; 3) broad consumer acceptance. I know that\u2019s repeating a line from the piece, but on a technical basis L5 will be possible as soon as the software advances to a point where it can handle the workloads - and that\u2019s not really that far off. My goal wasn\u2019t to suggest Mobileye will replicate 70% market share in L5 but to rather point out that Intel is practically excluded from the conversation as being a player and that shouldn\u2019t be the case. Also, Nvidia is often cited and their AV push is one of the end markets that are regularly touted as making them a differentiator when Mobileye has a much strong competitive positioning in the space. I think the market is missing this completely. \n\nAs for Tiger Lake, I really think we need independent testing. But there are also a couple of things we already know: 50 OEM designs are shipping this fall with 150 expected by next year. People on Reddit and in this thread are overly focused on people building their own PCs or people who are aware of the benchmark differences between Ryzen and Tiger Lake when that\u2019s just such a fractional percentage of the user market for ultra-thin high performance. And despite all of the various issues at Intel and all of the so-called domination by AMD the past couple of years, their share of the PC market is only 20%. I think that speaks directly to my point about the composition of the market itself, and as Intel muscles its way into more design ranges, I think it\u2019s likely to put a ceiling on AMD market share advances for the time being. \n\nI think the community gets so caught up with the truly amazing turnaround by AMD (I wrote a post saying as much a couple months ago) and the conversation gets distorted into AMD having a lead when market share figures just don\u2019t remotely suggest that. That leads me to the server discussion. I believe in your analysis your wrote about the higher core count and how Intel won\u2019t be capable of matching AMD on that with Xeon, but that\u2019s not how customers choose their components. It\u2019s all about price-per-performance. They aren\u2019t simply putting one 128 core EPYC and calling it a day. In the case of Cloudflare selecting EPYC for their new GenX server, they specifically mentioned how they chose 64 over 128 because the performance advantage was marginal for a much higher price. When you think about the volumes that these are being purchased in for edge providers/hyperscale cloud vendors, that point only gets compounded. \n\nThis is directly addressed in the write-up, where AMD had a massive lead on price-per-performance until the Xeon refresh. And I think that\u2019s a huge reason why you\u2019ve seen them get design wins and boost market share in data center. But again - their market share is only 10% all the while they have had this price advantage, thread count advantage, etc. So how can that be the case? Ultimately this is why I disagree about the data-centric segment being a misnomer, because they are independent markets insofar as the purchasing strategies and rationale. \n\nI think what happens most times is that folks get caught up on the technical factors when the people who are making these decisions are not engineers - they are buyers. Yes, the buyers get counseled by their technical teams but that\u2019s just one element of it. B2B relationships, upgrade/vendor change risk, single-vendor risk, contract terms, and many more non-technical factors drive these decisions just as much if not more. And considering servers are exclusively an enterprise buyer versus the PC being a consumer buy, I think it would be a mistake to lump these together. I do business development and strategy, and I\u2019ve been in these conversations. I just have yet to see a compelling alternative explanation for how AMD has 10% market share in data center despite everything you covered. \n\nAs for the edge server specifically, I think GPU is a wild card as you could totally be right. But edge servers will also greatly expand demand for CPU and  storage. I think the conversation on here and elsewhere is stuck in the past where there is one winner and one loser. The market is going to be too large for that, and it will absolutely require two players at least. As I said, single-vendor risk is a real thing in all industries but especially IT. It\u2019s why Azure was able to claw out a sizeable #2 position in IaaS/PaaS when years before everyone said the \u201ccloud wars\u201d were over and AWS was the undisputed king. The quantities and demand is too large for one player to dominate. And because of that, I think edge servers is a trend that will lift both boats. But IoT is a different use case and integrated/hybrid graphics will be much more applicable for that type of device. So graphics could see a boost there as well. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think the conversation is inverted. People expect Intel to lose market share in legacy businesses while Nvidia and AMD are carving out dominant positions in higher-growth end markets. But Intel is also in those same end markets, and in some cases Intel has the dominant position at present. And even in the event they lose market share, these markets are so vast that it will still meaningfully drive Intel shares higher. My own 2023 projections of less than 5x P/S really is not that rosy considering NVDA is trading above 26x. But what if Intel doesn\u2019t keep losing market share because of some of the factors I mentioned? Or what if they are successful with discrete GPUs? Those possibilities are priced into shares 0%. And I tend to think when the market overwhelmingly biased the narrative in one direction, if the narrative needs to correct, it causes a serious reversion in the share price - in both directions. \n\nGiven the strength of Intel\u2019s financial performance despite the struggles, its attractive valuation, and its more aggressive push to catch up to advances by AMD, Intel offers much better downside protection relative to the hyper growth names that are exposed to the possibility of a tech correction in the near-term. All in all, comparatively lower risk for potential significant upside.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Really great response, cheers. Incidentally, have you got any reading I could do on Lvl 5? I was under the impression than it was a bit of a misnomer, given that even most humans can't achieve lvl5 properly, and had no idea we were that far advanced already. I thought we'd essentially need general purpose AI to get lvl5, which we're obviously nowhere near. \n\nI just want to clarify what the whole manufacturing process thing means - it's quite complicated and technical so maybe you didn't fully understand what I meant. Think of it like this: the 'EUV' machine lets you make round wheels. Meanwhile, Intel's current process can only make square wheels. Obviously Intel realises their mistake in wheel shape, and are desperately trying to redesign their wheel so it can be round - this is their 7nm process. The 10nm process simply can't be round. Intel's been at the forefront of wheel design since wheels were invented, and it's been seen as a huge competitive advantage for them.For the first time basically ever, Intel is behind due to a decade of mismanagement and perfect execution from competition. Will the chips fall in the right way again to allow Intel to regain a lead? I don't think so.\n\nWorking on that assumption, as time passes, until 2022 at the earliest, the pure performance difference between AMD/Intel will simply widen, both as a result of inferior processess(performance) and inferior prices(per-socket licensing for software means it's cheaper to run fewer high-core count CPUs than more low-core count CPUs). To compete Intel will be forced to lower prices, compressing margins. Your assumption of 34% net income margin, 5% above 2019 seems very optimistic in this context in my opinion.\n\nAt the end of the day, Intel is an engineering company selling engineered products. Financial management can only improve your performance so far; the actual product is far more important.\n\nThat all being said, I agree that the expanding TAM wil lift everyone - at that point it becomes more a matter of who can supply enough chips, where Intel's mature 14nm node gives it an advantage. You'd just have to hope that the increasing demand comes either very soon, or very late, and not during the awkward few years when they are far inferior to the competition.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, I appreciate that and enjoying the exchange. For the record, I am positive on AMD and have been for a long time (since sub-$15). I just think that consensus on Intel has become overly driven by sentiment and near-term behavioral factors that are distracting from a lot of developments that could drive shares higher. On L5, I\u2019ll have to circle back on the software because it\u2019s totally dependent on the hardware architecture. For Tesla, they will need more robust AI because their system is a computer vision system whereas everyone else (including Mobileye) recognizes that lidar and radar are needed for redundancy. \n\nNo, I followed the general thrust of your manufacturing argument. I understand how EUV affects yields and core count, and that your argument is that Intel can\u2019t ever rival AMD on core count/price because of the yields. What I still am struggling with is what is preventing Intel from adopting EUV at the same level as TSMC/AMD? TSMC doesn\u2019t actually produce the EUV scanners, they buy them from ASML like Samsung and Intel. While surely there is know-how involved with optimizing the process, Intel spends more than 4x on R&D versus TSMC. So all TSMC has really been doing is adopting it earlier and at higher levels. \n\nIt really wouldn\u2019t be all to difficult for Intel to simply pay up for top engineers and steal them from TSMC. And two Japanese companies, Lasertec and Tokyo Electron are also producing EUV equipment. Intel could simply buy Lasertec for $7bn if they wanted to if there are supply constraints with scanners. Not to mention that there is a technology hurdle for the jump from 5nm to 3nm that will take years to get past (https://semiengineering.com/whats-next-for-euv/). So the argument that TSMC/AMD have this unassailable lead in EUV just seems a little premature to me. Product upgrades take much longer than people recognize. Intel\u2019s 6-month delay really isn\u2019t the end of the world as long as they get it out in 2021. \n\nI greatly respect the detail at which you drilled down on the technical aspects of the manufacturing process, but despite AMD\u2019s EUV lead, their gross margins are still only 44%. It would take years and years of AMD having this advantage for the gap in gross margins you suggest via this process to turn into parity between the two. And I just don\u2019t see AMD having years up on Intel in EUV, maybe one and a half. \n\nAnd on the net income point - it will be boosted by much greater demand for Atom with IoT devices. While currently a smaller percentage of revenues, Atom has disproportionately high margins. The volumes for IoT devices will be in the billions, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really that far of a leap once Intel optimizes its EUV manufacturing process.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> On L5, I\u2019ll have to circle back on the software because it\u2019s totally dependent on the hardware architecture.\n\nIf I'm understanding you correctly, I find your argument a bit disingenious to be honest. We've had the raw theoretical hardware performance needed for L5 for years. The price of the hardware may be dropping rapidly, but that's irrelevant if the software isn't progressing at a much more rapid pace than it historically has.\n\n>It really wouldn\u2019t be all to difficult for Intel to simply pay up for top engineers and steal them from TSMC.\n\nI'm not saying that Intel will never be able to reach EUV, simply that they'll reach it far too late. As you pointed out, product design cycles are take years. Intel's 10nm is 3 (arguably 4 and counting) years delayed. You can't simply poach talent and apply them to products coming out tomorrow, or even 2 years down the road (ignoring IP constraints). Intel's 6 month delay means if they're on schedule, they won't have a EUV process until 'late-2022/early2023' if on schedule. By that time, TSMC is scheduled to have 3nm. Again, unless the stars align and Intel executes perfectly (which imo would require leadership reshuffling, but that's a whole other topic) AND TSMC cocks up, Intel cannot catch up on their manufacturing process. With an eye on the past, having a process lead IS an unassailable lead. EUV was simply a tool by which TSMC gained the lead, but it's not the thing that's keeping them in front.\n\n>it will be boosted by much greater demand for Atom with IoT devices.\n\nWhat's the reasoning for Atom in IoT? IoT seems a perfect use case for ARM processors - super low power requirements. I don't see Intel getting a foothold in this market at all unless they decide to use contra-revenues again.

They had a pretty nice rally going in to the split on August 31 so a bit of a breather would not be surprising.\n\nHowever a bit longer term, I\u2019m extremely bullish on the company. Their sales have remained very strong in spite of the pandemic. They have become one of the premier names in WFH technology equipment.\n\nBut there are two even bigger reasons why I am so bullish right now. The first is the rollout of 5G around the world. As this technology becomes more widespread, more and more new or upgraded mobile devices are going to be sold. This will be especially in demand in areas where WFH is being widely embraced, however it will eventually become the new standard that everyone is going to want to use. The fact that the rollout will be phased in across the world combined with consumers adopting it in a staggered fashion as it becomes more affordable will serve to provide demand for mobile sales for several years to come. Especially now, with an increasing number of users ditching their computers and using the iPad as their primary computing device, this is going to mean mobile demand for iPads and Apple Watches as well...not just iPhones!\n\nThe second big reason I am so bullish is Apple\u2019s announcement that they are switching to their own Apple silicon and ditching Intel as the manufacturer of their CPUs for the Mac lineup. This has so many benefits for Apple, and they have been well documented elsewhere, that it is simply a \u201cno-brainer\u201d! The bottom line is that the performance benefits for Mac users should drive sales for years to come...and the cost and control benefits for Apple are going to drop straight to their bottom line!\n\nThese two big technology changes, combined with an improved outlook for the pandemic situation over the next couple of years and just the normal Apple business demand in day to day operations all added together sound to me like Apple will continue setting quarterly and annual earnings records that will support the stock well for the foreseeable future.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc", "aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "If my kids online school has taught me anything: Chromebooks are trash compared to my five year old MacBook.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019re right, but that Chromebook was 1/5th the price.

Of course, there's an increase in the number of people investing in Robinhood that drove the share prices up, but most of it was based on, IMO, fanboying, speculation, and the mentality of not wanting to be left out.\n\nSo when Tesla launched a $5bil capital increase after the stock split, important people in TSLA started selling stocks, and the correction kicked in, people started to panic and started selling. I suspect stop-limit orders where if TSLA stocks dropped to a certain point an automatic sell happens also kicked in en masse, dropping the price further.\n\nThere were people that remained were hoping that the inclusion in S&P500 would bring the price back up, but since it was not included those people will probably try to sell as well on Tuesday.

There will still be people who are willing to ride the waves and wait till battery day.

Ditto if SB was looking to minimize their exposure.\n\n(Banks in general can't trade stocks - see the Volcker rule - so they normally hedge using bonds. This is why /ZB makes a useful indicator for that type of activity... and those folks weren't doing very much. All of that panic selling was retail, plus MM dynamic hedging when *that* batch of orders hit the tape and went past the expected move. It's not exactly what I'd call the end of the world.)", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5849255919456482}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6735447645187378}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6778020858764648}, {"body": "Ok so was it the retail investors or the banks that drove up prices?

Tesla is unlike anything else in the market. It's less a business and more an altruistic pursuit of one man to get to Mars, and to save the Earth in the process. I know it sounds a bit hyperbolic, but I don't think Tesla will ever be an entity like an automaker or as traditional as Microsoft or Google.\n\nTheir focus is energy, FSD, and ML/AI driven technological disruptions. Tesla power is one front, Infinite upside. Vehicle 2 Grid: Infinite upside. FSD + RoboTaxis: Infinite upside. Trucks is commercial, Semis is freight transport. If Tesla or anyone else gets to 500W/kg, eVTOLS are now a thing. eFreight Cargo vessels that are FSD'd wouldn't be too far on the horizon thereon and Tesla's tech framework + energy and vertical integration experience would align them for nearly any motion market *anywhere*: Earth, Moon, or Mars.\n\nYou can't take any other EV on the market made by a traditional automaker and put it into space and it'll work, but SpaceX launched Musk's cherry roadster into a million year orbit around the sun. The car functioned for a solid half a dozen hours in hard vacuum. So they now know for a fact that their vehicles would work just fine on in space.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that Tesla basically is capitalizing on nearly a 2-3 decade of stagnation and vertically integrating all tech advancements into a single stack that is driven by a mission that isn't about drawing high margins per sale or standing up a supply chain that exists to extract maximum value from each little part (see: APPL and their dongle behavior). It's not like the market wasn't incapable of doing what Tesla has done. The know-how, money, and tech has been there for nearly a decade now. Some of the tech has definitely been there for maybe even longer. But oil and gas and ICE has saw fit to squash any such advancements; catch and kill.\n\nThe world class treatment given to Tesla by China, Germany, and even cities in the US that are falling head over heels to get a Giga factory in their own to be a new hub of high tech and energy jobs. Tesla is always going to disrupt. Each factory their build is an improvement of the last, to increase production yield. I don't have enough data about other car companies, but we never hear anything about ford or chrysler or toyota evolving their factories in the way that Tesla does.\n\nFinally, their disruptions is causing a lot of pain for established players, and I'm sure they're doing what they can do dampen the progress of the company in some way or form. So they're always going to be volatile. Stock is down to 391, it'll probably shoot back up to 450 or more on or after battery day.\n\nTl;dr, I don't think Tesla will never *not* be volatile.

My point is Tsla may not have much competition now, but like with any evolving industry competition is coming. Alot of this competition already has dedicated factory spaces in countries around the world that they could retrofit to advance their production needs. Further alot of these companies would not just be focusing on a niche market sector(EVs), but also be producing and collecting data from their other market segments(trucks,non-evs, etc.).

Why is the behavior so slow and so token-like?\n\n\n>They'll have data collection programs, but many more cars in production\n\nTesla already has 1 million EVs on the road. Combining all the others together, doesn't come close to this number. Additionally, data collection using what? LiDAR? The technology which breaks the *moment* the road/map geometry changes? The technology which costs up to 10k per car? And I'd assume you'd want consumers to pay for a technology that works *only* in geo-fenced regions where their so called FSD won't work outside of it.\n\nGood way to convince customers to pay more on a feature that gives you less.\n\n>Niche market sector (EVs)\n\nI'm sorry, are you serious? This entire argument is about Tesla's position against the industry where it doesn't consider EVs to be niche, but mainstays for all sectors.\n\n>collecting data from other segments (trucks, non-evs, etc.)\n\nYour details in these sectors is very sparse, not much *weight* to your words. What are these other sectors? Planes? W/kg isn't there yet. Ships? W/kg isn't there yet; rail? Most commercial world wide rail is already electric, so not sure what sector you're talking about.\n\n>You have no fundamental reasons, just hope\n\nI got two points for you buddy:\n\n1. My arguments are a lot more grounded than yours. You're handwaving so many things that Tesla went nearly bankrupt in doing, and implying all the automakers will do the same, is hilarious. Tesla is where it's at because it could vertically integrate and because it's culture allows for an engineer to tell his boss he's wrong and prove that he's wrong, and then the proof is incorporated in the vehicle. Sandy Munro confirmed through his experience in the industry, that you try that ANYWHERE else and you'll get fired in traditional auto space. For them to be able to start at a point to be able to compete with Tesla, they'd need a complete cultural overhaul where a junior engineer can bluntly tell a director: you're wrong cause of physics, and he isn't fired on the spot for political reasons.\n\n\n2. Tesla has become an idea of the future, it's cutting through a 20-30 year period of stagnation, where ICE tech hasn't radically improved, and EV tech has existed only as means for the companies to make more ROI on their earnings report, no car company in the last 20 years has been *serious* about mass producing EVs, because doing so kills their supply chain; where they make all their money. Every single mass market ICE vehicle sold off the lot is sold at a loss. They all make their money from services, parts, labor, third party supplier agreements, etc. EVs completely kill all that, because for it to be a threat to Tesla, it ***ALL,*** MUST become vertically integrated.\n\nA horizontally integrated company cannot compete with a vertically integrated company.\n\nNASA's SLS project is horizontally integrated. In 10 years and 11 billion in spending, they've managed to build the core stage and side boosters up to the initial no crew test flight.\n\nIn the same period of time, using the same amount of money, SpaceX, has built the F9, FH, Cargo *and* Crew Dragon (that took astronauts to the ISS and bought them back already), optimized the Merlin engines to a point where FH is mostly obsolete, put up 600 Starlink satellites including designing them and formalizing them for launch *and* is on its way to replace it all with Starship that's TSTO, half or less the cost of the F9, and contains a flight capable Full Flow Stage combustion engine; the most advanced rocket motor on the planet.\n\nElon is the Chief engineer at SpaceX and is basically the \"ceo\" of Tesla, and he splits his time across both.\n\nFor automakers to compete with Tesla, they need to be able to copy everything that SpaceX *and* Tesla is doing. Both companies have disrupted *and* delivered. That's a grounded reason for hope; and most people's hope in Tesla is much more rational than the irrational position that other car manufacturers are going to overnight catch up with Tesla figuratively speaking.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The stock is still trading at a 1000 p/e but yes keep thinking you are on the on ramp when in reality the start of the exit ramp has just begun.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh yes, I'm sure that's the case when countries and states are falling head over heels to have a Tesla factory in their backyard.
