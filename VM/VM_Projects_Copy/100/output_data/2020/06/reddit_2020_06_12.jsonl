Would you try to repeat this again in the future?\n\nAnytime you are in a trade and you feel extremely anxious or nervous, that is not a trade you want or should be in. You will make rash decisions and fear takes over your decision making.\n\nWhy don't you instead gamble when the odds are on your side and with the capital you can afford to lose? Let me explain one of the mechanism to do so.\n\nLet's say you start with a 10k account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Don't trade more than 5% - 10% on any position so 1k per position.  Max 20% (2k) if you have strong conviction and in those cases you can size in half a position 1k at a time. This allows you to average down in case the market brings down your stock due to whatever news.\n* Cut your losses when your options are down 10% to 30%, Market is telling you that your idea/execution was wrong so get out. This way you're not rationalizing with your self how the idea would work out.\n* Sell half when you're up 100%+ or whatever you're comfortable with and let the remaining run with an intention to close out the position if it drops below 50% gain is a good strategy.\n* Give your trade time to play out. The best money (5x, 10x or 20x)  is made over period of several days or weeks when the trend is on your side.  Lately market has moved more off hours than intraday.\n* Avoid options that expire in less than a week or two. Try 3 weeks to a few months out. You get less effected by time decay and if the position doesn't move in your direction, you can get out as well rather than waiting for it to expire worthless.\n* Add to winners if you see solid momentum and trend continuation but move your stop loss accordingly so you can get out in the green if it moves against you.\n\nHave a a set of rules (any rules not only this) that allows you to be mechanical instead of emotional.\n\nContinue to follow a rule based trading and you will see your portfolio will start to trend in the right direction, lets say after 10 trades in a month 5  are 100%+ winners while 5 are losing trades that you manage to get out at 20% loss on average. On a 10k account you will be up 4k in over a month with a 50% winning rate (i'm simplifying of course but let that sync in for a second). In a month your account value is up by 40%.\n\nNow you see a great opportunity and you are itching to YOLO trade because someone posted an insane DD and you agree as it does make sense or you disagree and say \"Fuck it, I'm in\" You can YOLO all of the 4K in that position or YOLO half 2k.\n\nThis is a much better situation to be in because\n\na) you YOLO'd only your profit or half of it. You can't blow up your account.\n\nb) you are not going to be emotional about this trade and make rash decision\n\nc) you can let the trade play out to be 10 bagger or 20 bagger\n\nThe key difference here is you've earned the right to YOLO after trading properly for a month. Imagine your TSLA trade today was only with your profit for the year. Would you have sold?\n\nStop watching so much gain porn and believing that you can do so as well easily as soon as tomorrow and quit your day job and live \"the life\". This is the shit that gets people to bet their entire account in a short term FDs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt takes time to perfect your craft so relax and figure out how you can develop a better trading system that suits your style.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Yolo trade only with your profits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy your weekend.", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "Underrated comment right here.

Find your indicators that give you confidence in your trade and lean on them.\n2. Have your stop loss set so you don't have to decide on the fly. Ideally the same for profit, or at least have a strategy on how to decide when to sell (e.g. once I hit X profit I sell 1/2 or all)\n3. Don't be too hard on yourself. This stuff isn't easy at all. Things move fast, emotions can run high, and you can easily make mistakes. I did today. I accidentally bought 10x the puts I was trading with today on one marginal trade and it cost me 50% of my day's gains. \n4. Trade smaller until you build up your confidence and find a system that works for you.\n5.

The volume of VIX reflects the volume of otm puts being purchased on SPX. It is literally a math equation. The fundamentals you're getting are derivative values from hedging behavior on SPX over the last few weeks. \n\nThe reason why fundamentals don't always work on VIX is because VIX doesn't always inverse SPX and it doesn't reflect actual asset prices. In fact, VIX can rise while SPX rises and also fall with SPX. All that matters is how large institutions are hedging their portfolios.
