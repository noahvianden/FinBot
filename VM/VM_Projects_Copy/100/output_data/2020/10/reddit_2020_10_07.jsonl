Even if COVID is somehow fixed next year, their film franchise pipeline has a big air gap in it now. \n\nBut my harshest criticism is for their Disney Plus strategy of giving away the farm for $3/month.  They're giving people everything they have for nothing.  They could have charged more or given less, or both.  Giving their entire content away for nothing has just trained everyone that the content is worth about 0.3 cents per title.\n\nAnd high subscriber signups is pointless when you're losing huge money on every single one. They could have priced it a lot higher, for break even at least, and taken a more sustainable and profitable road to building up the subscribers.  And if they would have done that, COVID would have played out to be a massive windfall profit, instead of a charity handout.  And the problem with streaming services is it's easy to sell when you're charging nothing, but once you raise the price at all, there will be backlash.\n\nLoeb's idea of using the dividend money to burn in the furnace that is Disney Plus doesn't make sense.  It's just burning up money.  And besides, if they need cash, you can borrow for free these days, so there's no real need to raid the dividend account.  \n\nThey need to figure out a way to recast Disney Plus into something that can at least break even.  And that's going to mean customers paying more and getting less.  Like they used to.  The Disney way.\n\n My strategy would be to split up their approximately 6 or 8 content mountains (things like Marvel, ESPN, Disney Cartoons, Star Wars, The Simpsons, etc) and get people used to paying $3 for EACH of the content piles, or some bundle that includes multiple content groups.  Yes, it's cable 2.0. But guess what? That's the path to profit.  Just pipe video data to each subscribers probably costs them more than double what they as a fee.

Oil/Gas takes up a large amount of space for processing, storage, and pipelines (there's also the area that oil has decimated due to spills and waste deposit). Solar panels can sit upon existing structures, thus not taking up additional space of the earth's surface. Your reasoning against solar panels being inefficient is dated as well. It was true that solar panels were net energy negative up until 2011, but since then the technology has allowed solar panels to be net positive and they continue to become more energy positive. This happens with new technology, it continues to become more efficient and effective. The toxic elements associated with panels is a concern, this is why I favor other green energies (wind & hydro) more than solar panels. However, it is likely that solar technology will advance to not rely upon toxic materials. This advancement in not being reliant upon toxic or limited resources is also occurring in battery technology.\n\nNow look at ICEs, the gasoline engine technology is very old and has not advanced much in the last 50 years. The latest big boost in efficiency was just achieved by Mazda with their SKYACTIV-X engine which increases efficiency by \\~20%. Even then, the efficiency is still much lower than an electric engine and cannot product the same torque.

Solar panels need a lot more space to produce the same amount of energy as a conventional turbine.\n\n>\"However, it is likely that solar technology will advance to not rely upon toxic materials. This advancement in not being reliant upon toxic or limited resources is also occurring in battery technology.\" \n\nThis is the assumption that is always made that I referenced in my original post. Currently, batteries (and solar panels) rely on metals that are difficult and dirty to mine. Mining these metals is so harmful for the environment that - when you take the entire lifecycle into account - BEVs actually contribute more GHG to the atmosphere than conventional ICE. The studies that say otherwise have actually made assumptions that recycling the batteries will someday be possible in order to offset those emissions. Unfortunately that is not the case. The problem is only exasperated with the fact that the tech is advancing so quickly that there is no \"standard\" in battery tech so research in recycling basically gets reset with every new type of battery.\n\nThat is what I mean when I say \"barring a groundbreaking discovery\" BEVs are not a good solution. \n\nI agree with you that ICE can't compete with EV efficiency, but I think the concern should be about emissions as I mentioned a couple paragraphs earlier. BEVs are not as clean as they are advertised. \n\nWhile you are correct that EV motors do produce more torque, the average passenger vehicle don't need 400/500/600+ ftlbs of torque. You'd be right to say that you need torque for hauling stuff, but there's the other problem with EVs: the performance degrades under extended load due to losses from over heating. Not to mention batteries are big heavy as all hell, so to power big motors for a long range, you lose a lot of space and add a lot of weight for storing/hauling stuff. The list goes on...\n\nIt's the eFuels that are the most enticing to me. Audi currently produces and sells one form of eFuel which I think is a synthetic natural gas - but don't quote me on that. eFuels are cool because they use carbon capturing technology to take carbon out of the air and then they combine it with hydrogen to synthetic hydrocarbons that have the same or better performance than natural fuels and can be used as a direct substitute.

{"title": "My Renewable Energy Portfolio Update", "selftext": "Hi everybody. I made a post last month with some brief information on the renewable stocks that I'm invested in. \n\nHere's the link to that: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ice312/a_guide_for_those_looking_to_invest_in_renewable/\n\n-----------------------\n\nI'm going to update you all on my portfolio allocation and any important news from the companies. The stocks are listed in order by % of my renewable portfolio.\n\n**NOTE**: I've added to several of my positions and increased my cost basis so my personal % gain might be down in some of these stocks despite drastic price appreciation. \n\n---------------------\n\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** : (19% gain from my last post) (654% gain total)\n\n(41% of my renewable portfolio)\n\n\n\n----------------------\n\nI'll focus on recent updates from Tesla's solar business because this post is about renewables. First of all, battery day in September announced plans with a future goal of 56% price reductions in Tesla LIO batteries. This applies to Tesla's energy storage business and will make their Powerpack and Megapack the most affordable energy storage solutions in the market. They've also cut prices on their solar panels and solar roof products. \n\nTesla is still a strong buy in my opinion. It's incredibly volatile but in the long term I see Tesla being the most valuable company in the world.\n\n------------------------\n\n**SolarEdge** (**SEDG)**: (32% gain from my last post) (88% gain overall)\n\n(12% of my renewable portfolio) \n\n-------------------\n\nThere isn't much recent news from SolarEdge. They continue to dominate the global inverter market and have been given a series of analyst upgrades. The only notable piece of news of late is a $550 private stock offering to raise money for future expansion.\n\nI'm still bullish on SolarEdge and I believe they will be crucial in the renewable future. I added several shares and more than doubled my position in September when the stock price dropped under $200. However, they trade at a premium P/E ratio right now and are overvalued by most traditional metrics. If you are a long term investor I think you'll be rewarded for buying in at these prices but don't be too surprised if there's a stock price correction in the near future. \n\n------------------------\n\n**Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**: (59% gain since my last post) (74% gain overall)\n\n(9.20% of my renewable portfolio)\n\n---------------------\n\nCanadian Solar also had a private stock offering of $200 million to raise capital recently. They sold a solar project to BluEarth Renewables and are announced another project in Mexico. The big piece of news here is that they are preparing a \"Carve out IPO\" of their Chinese module and systems solutions business. This allows investors in China to own part of this specific subsidiary of CSIQ. It provides Canadian Solar with additional capital to expand in China, which is the world's largest solar market. \n\nCanadian Solar has also seen industry consolidation towards the top players in module manufacturing, which includes themselves. This is a great trend for their future prospects. I added a ton of CSIQ when their stock price dropped in September. I'll keep adding on any dips.\n\nYes, Canadian Solar's stock has gone up tremendously in the past month. However, they are still undervalued in my opinion and trade at a measly P/E ratio of under 10. This is another long-term hold for me if you're willing to ride out the volatility.\n\n------------------\n\n**Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**: ( 136% gain from my last post)  (182% gain overall) \n\n(8.3% of my renewable portfolio)\n\n---------------------\n\nJinko Solar reported a blowout quarter last week, beating on earnings by 97%. In other news, they are set for an IPO of their subsidiary in China's stock market. This has further increased their stock price and led to additional capital for expansion. Jinko is another company poised to benefit from industry consolidation, specifically in China. They've begun developing projects in Vietnam and Japan, plus they have many more in their pipeline.\n\nJinko has shot up an absurd amount recently. It seems like every day they're up another 10%. I'm expecting a slight correction in the short term, but you could miss out by not buying at these prices. Overall, I think Jinko has unique access to the Chinese Solar market and will continue to grow their top and bottom lines for their foreseeable future. Because of this, I consider Jinko a long-term buy and hold even at these new prices. They still only trade at a 13 P/E ratio and it seems like the market is finally starting to increase these companies' ratios.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**: (41% gain from last post) (83% gain overall)\n\n(7.20% of my renewable portfolio)\n\n--------------------\n\nSince my last post, Enphase has announced several new projects which investors have reacted positively to. Enphase's microinverters will help power projects in Australia, New Hampshire, Mexico and Minneapolis. Furthermore they are increasing production of their IQ7 inverters in Europe and Australia. This international expansion comes as a big plus, because they have a large market share in the United States, but could use some international diversification. \n\nOverall, it's been only good news from Enphase which has led to a stock price increase. Inverters are a great way to invest in renewables and Enphase is poised to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of the impending solar boom.\n\n------------------------\n\n**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**: (6% gain from last post) (49% gain overall)\n\n(6% of my renewable portfolio)\n\n--------------------\n\nTPIC gets very little news coverage and there's been no recent news. I'd recommended viewing their investor relations presentation and reading my last post. One of their EV partners who I can't name on here or this post will get removed (rhymes with LurkMorse) has expanded production which will benefit TPIC. Also the wind market has seen increased demand in Q3 which will probably be reflected in TPIC's earnings. \n\nEverything that I said in my last post still stands. TPIC is exciting to me although the low margins are a bit concerning. I think they are a good pure wind investment and there aren't many out there.\n\n----------------------\n\n**Vestas** **Wind** **(VWDRY)**: (18% gain from last post) (122% gain overall)\n\n(5% of my renewable portfolio)\n\n--------------------\n\nVestas has reported a number of wind turbine sales in countries such as India, Russia, China, Poland, USA, Vietnam, Egypt, Netherlands, Greece, Columbia & more since my last post. They continue to be a consistent beast in the wind market.\n\nIf you want to diversify into Wind, this is the company to do it. Their share price has gone up over the last year but I don't see that stopping any time soon.\n\n-------------------\n\n**BrookField** **Renewables** **(BEPC)**: (31% gain from last post) (37% gain overall)\n\n(4% of my renewable portfolio)\n\n-----------------------\n\nThe only news out of BrookField Renewables recently is a $325 million secondary offering. They are a dividend play and have historically outperformed the market. Read up on my last post and their IR page for more info but I recommend BEPC if you're risk averse and like dividend stocks. \n\n-------------------------\n**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**: (16.40% gain from my last post) (12% gain overall)\n\n(3.90% of my renewable portfolio)\n\n---------------------\n\nHASI is the only new renewable company that I've bought since my last post. They are a REIT and pay out most of their earnings as dividends. Look up their investor presentation if you're interested but they invest in climate change infrastructure, including the land under renewable energy projects. \n\nI'm inclined to add to my investment in HASI to diversify a bit. Much like BEPC, HASI holds less risk and great dividends.\n\n\n------------------\n\n**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**: (5.6% gain from my last post) (33% gain overall)\n\n(3.80% of my portfolio)\n\n---------------------\n\nFirst Solar also announced a secondary offering to raise capital. Other than that the only news is a new project in Chile. \n\nFirst Solar has ran less than the other module manufacturers listed above and remains a dominant player in the U.S. market. I consider them a long term buy and hold at these prices.\n\n------------------------\n\n**SUMMARY**: **155%** **total** **gain** (75% gain excluding Tesla)\n\nWe have seen recent stock offerings from several of these companies to raise capital. This to me signals an expectation of increased demand in the future, as this capital will be used to expand production. \n\nThe election and Biden's climate plan is a major factor in why these companies have run so much as of late, but regardless of the election outcome, a renewable energy boom is inevitable. If Trump wins I expect a short-term pullback in several of these companies so look out for that. Either way though these companies are long-term 10 year holds and you shouldn't be concerned with short term swings. Any dip is a buying opportunity unless fundamentals change.\n\n------------------\n\nIf you believe that renewables are the future, I highly recommend taking matters into your own hands and investing in these companies or other renewable companies. There are also several great ETFs, TAN is probably my favorite out of these.\n\n\n\n**EDIT**: I'll probably make a post breaking down the holdings of the renewable energy ETFs because people seem interested in their differences. Look for that in the next week or so\n\n**EDIT2**: I'm 19 years old with a 10 year investing horizon so all of these are long-term holds for me", "id": "j6vu2f", "created_utc": 1602093665.0, "score": 616, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 208, "comments": [{"body": "Vestas is such a winner!

Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the seven-nanometer delay? **Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January.**  \n>  \n>So how do I think about the drivers of that seven-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins?  \n>  \n>**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n>  \n>Yeah. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year 'cause it's clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020.  \n>  \n>And we're -- part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products.  \n>  \n>**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n>  \n>**But wait a minute. If I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in -- when you first gave the annual guidance six months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half?**  \n>  \n>**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n>  \n>It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue, Stacy.  \n>  \n>**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n>  \n>Well, I think I'll start with our full-year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's --  \n>  \n>**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n>  \n>**Yeah. But you're just making it sound like where you can typically get to, is there --**  \n>  \n>**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n>  \n>Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So --  \n>  \n>**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n>  \n>Sorry.  \n>  \n>**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n>  \n>Full-year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first six months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year.  \n>  \n>And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the one-point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the data center group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category.  \n>  \n>We know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield.  \n>  \n>If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year.

Chevy bolt or volt or whatever. Toyota has a few decent hybrids. But they\u2019re resorting to pairing up with Subaru to try and make some EV\u2019s. They just pushed their planned releases out another 2 years. There\u2019s a few more out there. None of them made the impact Tesla is making. \n\nWhy? They\u2019re boomer companies. They just don\u2019t get it. They launch a car and move onto the next car design. Tesla launches a car and continuously sends updates to make it faster, longer range, better AI. Toyota is the only respectable one among them and even they\u2019re struggling to make EV\u2019s. \n\nWhich bring me back to- why? They\u2019re (GM and Ford and whatever) using existing infrastructure. Tesla has put BILLIONS into building from the ground up 100% electric vehicles and electric vehicle manufacturing plants. Tesla is like a specialist heart surgeon while Ford and others are general family doctors. \n\nThey won\u2019t be able to compete with Tesla until they go all in on EV\u2019s. From the ground up. Entire new factories that ONLY specialize in EV\u2019s. Teams of engineers that ONLY design EV\u2019s. None of this half baked bullshit. Tesla just reinvented the battery. What does any other car manufacturer have on that?\n\nAnother reason why- Tesla is a software company as well as a car munufacturer. The boomer car companies suck at software. I\u2019ve seen burnt out taillights that throw \u201ccheck engine\u201d lights. They really, really suck at software and electronics. \n\nI\u2019d much rather have a car from the company that continuously improves and fixed car software and add features throughout the life of the vehicle. \n\nEven Porsche\u2019s latest record selling EV is double the price of most Tesla\u2019s, much less range (192 miles compared to 400 for a model S), and almost exactly the same performances of 0-60 in 2.3ish seconds. The new Tesla Plaid versions are even faster. \n\nSo the newest, best, most cutting edge that Porsche is able to come up with doesn\u2019t beat Tesla in ANY category and it doesn\u2019t have any form of self-driving AI or access to the supercharger network and it costs $85,000 more than a performance model S Tesla. \n\nTesla has a big moat. It\u2019s years ahead. I think, if they copy Tesla and invest a ton of capital in building ground up EV plants, they might catch up to Tesla in 10-15 years.

{"title": "1987 Crash Comparison", "selftext": "Before everyone starts yelling at me to gtfo with my bear thesis let me start off by saying this is purely for discussion purposes. I made a comparison and I want to hear others thoughts on it. If it ends up behaving the same way, cool, if it doesn't it, well it wouldn't be the first time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo start off I looked at the September/October 1987 crash the ended with the infamous black monday on 10/19/1987\n\n[June-October 1987 SPX Chart](https://preview.redd.it/gnh9zj6uzqr51.png?width=1503&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4fafd70bbe827d47f27c572d00ac8c033277c0b)\n\nHere we can see SPX had an initial drop that turned into a falling wedge. In total losing about 8.5%. This then rebounded, forming a rising wedge which eventually hit its peak past the 0.618 fib retrace and about 2.7% short of the previous ATH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[June 2020-Present SPX Chart](https://preview.redd.it/5ev4p7sk0rr51.png?width=1503&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5117f63b8c63a76f1fb0a56e67a890f5812e29b)\n\nPresently SPX has also found a local bottom about 9.8% below the ATH. It broke out of the falling wedge and is forming (my opinion obviously) a rising wedge. If SPX follows a similar path we would see a reversal past the 0.618 fib retrace around the 3460-3490 range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the moment I am holding calls and will continue to until a break below this wedge is confirmed. The day SPX broke out of the rising wedge in 1987 it closed below the 20 and 50 day moving averages, so things could move very quickly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat thoughts do you have on this?
