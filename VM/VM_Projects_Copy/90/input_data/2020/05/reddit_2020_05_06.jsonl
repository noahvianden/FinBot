{"title": "Be prepared for sensational news.", "selftext": "The saying, \"The stock market predicts the future\" is older than most of us, yet most discard it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>“I always believe that **prices move** first and **fundamentals** come second.”\n\n\\~ Paul Tudor Jones\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can prove to **any thinking person** that extreme price moves can be forecast (within a *reasonable* margin of error) by understanding price patterns. All I need you to do is to suspend disbelief for long enough to consider the facts of the matter.  To engage in civil disagreement and to be receptive to evidence and testing.  I used to think this was not much to ask, March taught me better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've learned those who pretend to be asleep can not be awakened, so at this point I am only talking to those of you who can understand the difference between rational and radical. Sceptical and cynical.   **I'm speaking to the rational sceptics.** The people too  smart to believe what  I say, and not dumb enough to not bother to check if I might just be right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know that most big price moves in the market can be seen before they happen, and that when they happen there will  usually be news that is synchronised along with it. From a casual perspective, the news moves the market; but the move can be seen setting up before the news happens. It is in the charts first, and then it is in the news  later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Listen, I get it!\n\n# I know that sounds dumb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI absolutely, fully, understand that saying that is just like saying there is an  elephant in the tree. Right away your mind comes up with all the reasons an  elephant can not be in the tree. I GET THAT.  Be sceptical. Doubt what is doubtful,  do not refuse to look.  If you refuse to look, this is ignorance disguised as scepticism. If you can be shown, I can show you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't \"Make sense\", but it does happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Classic Template of a Bubble\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBubbles have always formed in extremely similar ways and anyone who understood how a bubble template worked and remained focused on executing trade plans based upon  that template would have always made a fortune. **This is a fact.** You can dispute if this will  happen again, but upon  full examination of the evidence it is indisputable it was the case for all  previous crashes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"People forecasting market crashes are always wrong!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe the boy who cries wolf has better eye sight.  To see something coming and to time the trades of that thing are really quite different. Picking a top is very hard because no matter what form of analysis you use there will be multiple false signals thrown out.  From all forms of analysis I know of, typically about 3 - 5 false signals come before the real trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 - 5 failed attempts is plenty to lure folks into thinking Cassandras of Wall Street should be mocked without due consideration, but rarely do any of these signals produce sells levels more than 20% off the mark.  The trouble is, in a bull market if you call a bear people will laugh at you for being wrong each time the market goes up 0.05%. Which is why I say a *reasonable* margin or error is required.\n\nFor example, in  late February I said if the Dow breaks under 29,000  [it could start to crash](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/).   That happened, but there are people here who seen me posting daily warning them this was coming (on other platforms) who'll say  my forecasts do not matter because [I was wrong in January.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/)  The market went up 600 points and down 10,000.  Here I learned only aim things at reasonable people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got this market top (and it went really well for me). I did not get it first time. I had some small  stop outs (as I do in ANY trade), but I did nail it.  I've posts from January [saying I was looking for it.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/)   Posts in February calling [both the  high and low of the move.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/)   I've shown how I used patterns from  the previous crashes over the [last 100 years to forecast this.](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/fwo5ut/it_shouldnt_work_but_over_the_last_100_years_this/)   I forecast [the low in  March](https://imgur.com/a/5bNi7vz), then the [move through April](https://imgur.com/a/WX5kwCP) (Full post for [previous links](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)) and then to watch for good news transfer over to [bad news around 25,000 Dow](https://imgur.com/a/OUy2dTM) ([Full  post](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've done all of this during times when everyone seems to think the market is entirely \"Irrational\" and making \"Unprecedented moves\" that I could not predict because  I've \"Never lived through a pandemic\" - but if the market is so irrational and doing things it's never done before,  why are you watching the news and wonder WTF is going on in the market in April, and I am writing posts about it in  March? I'm not smart. I just studied the patterns. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not know why it works. More and more as  I see it working while bad things are happening I wish it did not work, but it does. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you go through all my posts  you'll see my forecasts are very accurate. I'm sometimes a bit out. Often I make trades that I could have done better on. I am not perfect. I'm aware of my need for improvement in  various areas of my analysis - but the fact I am sometimes a bit wrong does not mean this is not working.  Me not being flawless does not mean there is not merit to what I'm using. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been right more than 90% of people I  see. I'm not bragging, I must spend 10,000% more time on this than 99% of people and so it stands to reason I understand it better.  I'm not smart, I just believe in something that works and most of you  think is a subject for mockery. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point in the pattern what would now be expected is [news events to start to slide](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/).  Something a bit bad. Then something a lot bad.

Both winning and losing signals are posted.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n========\n\n \n\nFind a three year forecast of the [Dow Jones bear market of the 2020's here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/three-year-forecast-of-dow-jones-crash/)\n\n\\---\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time.
