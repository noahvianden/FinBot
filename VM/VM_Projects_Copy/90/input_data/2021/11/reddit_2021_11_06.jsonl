{"title": "How uranium will give you a perma-hard erection and bring the wife back", "selftext": " TLDR: Uranium ETFs like URA, \\[Redacted\\] for those lazy to research, like me.\n\nPositions: Jan 2023 Calls on URA, \\[Redacted\\], \\[Redacted\\], \\[Redacted\\], CCJ\n\nI initially bought into uranium in early Sep dabbling my toes in U.UN, added way more between then and now using margin with momma's investments as collateral. Synthetic shares (short put, long calls) almost margin called my ass but that's the price you pay for mutated radioactive perma-hard dick.\n\n[Uranium Bull Thesis](https://josephcollinsul.medium.com/the-uranium-bull-thesis-ce6d49ebd219) and more resources at a certain uranium sub but I'll summarize what stimulates me.\n\n**HOW URANIUM WORKS**\n\nBasically, uranium is only used in energy production in nuclear reactors. You can get uranium from mining and decommissioned nukes.\n\nAt the moment, it's also the only sensible choice in replacing fossil fuels. Renewables are either geographically constrained or unreliable. You still need a stable baseload that is available 24/7. We've seen big energy storage projects (some Tesla bull just came) but between the lack of batteries for EVs and the still developing energy storage scene, nuclear is the here and now that has been time tested to be working.\n\n**WHAT STIMULATES ME (Back in September)**\n\n1. Demand/Supply deficit. Basically, year production of uranium cannot keep up with demand of uranium.\n\n2. Draw down of inventories. This mainly consists of stockpiles by utilities, supply after Japan's nuclear shutdown posts Fukushima and nuclear material from decommissioned nukes ([Megaton to Megawatts program](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel.aspx))\n\n3. Shift to EVs. More EVs mean a shift of energy needs from oil to electricity, the energy required by these cars will require more sources of energy. You can generate electricity from oil but not the other way round, nuclear will benefit this increase in electricity need.\n\n4. Price of uranium is still below the production cost for many companies (Roughly $60 based on what I've heard). IMO, this means this uranium play really can't go tits up (unless you get margin called out of your positions like I almost did).\n\n5. Small sector size. The total market cap of all uranium companies was under 40B back in Sep. Incoming cash will move this very easily.\n\n6. Commodities to equities ratio. It's even lower than peak dot-com bubble.\n\n7. [Sprott Physical Uranium Fund](https://www.sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/), goes pacman on the uranium spot market, vacuuming up supply. Has no redemption feature, so it's an one-way trip for uranium (long gone like the ex-girlfriend who will never return). Since inception on 19 July, it has amassed 36.4 million pounds of uranium, equivalent to roughly 20% of the annual consumption.\n\n8. To a nuclear power plant, the cost of uranium is miniscule. Compared to the cap-ex and other operating costs, it's much more important that the plant continues running than the cost of acquiring the uranium.\n\n**WHAT STIMULATES ME (NOW)**\n\nSomehow, even more bullish news came out in this two months. I'm almost as excited as I was when I was 4k from margin call during a pullback after opening 2500 synthetic shares in uranium after it ran up.\n\n1. China's 440B plan to build 150 new reactors between now and 2035. Allegedly, this is more than the total number that have been built around the world since 1980. A bit of digging showed that we have 442 operational reactors around the world, so might have been a reporting error comparing planned reactor units to built reactor plants. Still bull dick size bullish anyways.\n\n1.1 I [wrote up](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/qmg343/a_political_take_on_chinas_shift_to_uranium/) a short bit on the political side of China's turn to nuclear energy\n\n2. [Small modular reactors](https://www.energy.gov/ne/benefits-small-modular-reactors-smrs). Basically, factory manufactured nuclear reactors compared to current site built reactors. Advantages include, increased accessibility, lower cap-ex, increased security as the reactors are designed to be safe from the get go, addressing terror attacks and natural disaster risks. NuScale's SMR [reportedly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2018/08/29/how-far-do-you-have-to-run-after-a-small-modular-nuclear-meltdown/?sh=2e4a15b57393) can't even meltdown, it just cools off.\n\n3. EU's energy crisis. In the previous years, EU decided to shift to renewables in a bid to reduce carbon emissions, which in hindsight was a bad idea after these renewables showed their flaw in being unreliable, leaving EU's energy security in Russia's hands (EU is heavily reliant on Russia for natural gas exports). The natural gas shortage has sent natural gas prices up 6 times since April and this will the EU rethink their stance on nuclear.\n\n3.1. France doubled down on nuclear with a 5 year, 35B plan with 1B going to fund small modular reactors.\n\n3.2. UK's net-zero plan heavily relies on nuclear with big investments going into Rolls-Royce's small modular reactors.\n\n4. Japan's Liberal Democratic Party wins the election. This group is positive towards nuclear, allowing restarts of existing nuclear plants to meet Japan's energy needs. They have not agreed to building of any new plants but they've not out rightly rejected the notion unlike the 2nd largest party, Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.\n\n5. [Kazatomprom](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-announces-physical-uranium-fund) creates their own physical uranium fund. [Reportedly](https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1451970084746903560), the fund will create a base spot price of $80-90.\n\n6. [Sprott buys over \\[Redacted\\]](https://www.sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-asset-management-enters-agreement-with-north-shore-indices-inc-to-acquire-licensing-rights-to-the-index-tracked-by-the-north-shore-global-uranium-mining-etf/), bring exposure to its large base of commodities investors.\n\n**Post Nut**\n\nThe macro-economics of uranium is ultra-bullish. It's cyclical so you have previous years' data to compare to, (Spot price hit $134/pound in 2007 on less bullish news). Mining might not be easily understood by many of you (me included), so just buy an ETF like URA or URNM.\n\nBuying mining companies is basically leveraging yourself already, when their cost remains fixed, the % increase in uranium prices will be amplified in the % increase of earnings and thus stock price.\n\n***~~Secret Sauce (White)~~***\n\n~~You may or may not be able to weaponize the physical uranium funds.
