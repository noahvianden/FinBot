Essentially the choice you have is between generating wealth through compound interest over a time frame of multiple decades or gamble it all away for a tiny chance to get rich and most likely end up with close to nothing as you get older.

As you have correctly pointed out the biggest opportunities can be found in a market where other investors are fearful. The more stock prices fall the happier you should actually be [atleast in the short term] because it means that you can buy a lot of great companies for a very good price. Tho there are a few issues, as you are very inexperienced you will most likely end up sitting on your cash for way too long while in the meantime missing out on some easy profits. Looking at it afterwards it always seems obvious but spotting the right opportunities to invest while everybody else is fearful is a lot harder than it seems at first which is something you will probably learn sooner or later on your own. The second issue i see is that there really isn’t a reason to always gamble on just one company. If the whole market is for example tanking because of a global pandemic then why invest everything into one company in hopes of this company being the one to rise higher than the average one.

Also another thing you mention is that you don’t plan to gamble with money that you can’t afford to lose and while this is great this actually applies to the entirety of investing [with the exception being government bonds and other extremely safe investments]: Don’t invest any money that you can’t afford to lose either! \nAll in all i feel like you are on the right track and if you want then just go for it and try to spot good opportunities and invest your money but I believe that you will lose quite a lot this way. Again I can only stress that I don’t believe it makes sense to gamble on becoming rich in the short term and if you ever find yourself coming to that same conclusion a great point to start at would be „The intelligent investor“ by Benjamin Graham as it will give you a great overall understanding of the concept of value investing.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "If there was a legitimate get-rich-quick scheme, everyone would be rich.\n\nBecoming rich requires time and effort.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "With his income, and the advances in modern technology, it's not crazy to think he will live to be two maybe three hundred?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[It's from Talledgea Nights.
