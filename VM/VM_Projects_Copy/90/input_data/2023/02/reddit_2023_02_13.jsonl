Above 419.5 the next MAJOR resistance is 429.8.\n\nHowever, if we get a big miss tomorrow and a red open/ day we are going to start looking for 405.3 support (about a -1.8% move) and if we lose that the next MAJOR support is 400 (-3.2%).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37uhzg8bw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e842d01193b5e30374029ccbf232990e125003\n\nJust as impressive here is futures that it opened and was trading -0.4% almost all night last night only to open green and close up 1.2% today.\n\nWe are going to be looking for upside resistance to be tested at 4210 (1.5%+) and 4310 (3.8%+) for our major upside resistance levels. However, to the downside the major levels at 4085 (-1.6%) and 4030 (-2.9%) red day. \n\nAgain tomorrow post CPI we can see where we close out and go from there with some stronger trend and structure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyqouzqbw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=279fd2d99191f3ceea6a1b3bd1c601736a22b5f7\n\nI honestly was kind of surprised to see Tesla red today‚Ä¶ also today it spent almost 5 hours total today trading around 195. I haven‚Äôt seen Tesla hold that tight of a range for that long in a very long time. That was incredibly impressive. \n\nMajor upside targets for Tesla are 202.4 (4%+) and 215 (10.5%+). Downside targets are 178 (-7.3%) and 163 (-16.3%). Granted I don‚Äôt expect 163 tomorrow but this week or next that would be my target. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3xea8mdw0ia1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc30041fa765a6b54aee492d6956059760ffb08b\n\nLooking at the VIX what an incredible day for the VIX to open at 21.69 and fall al the way back to 20.37 to close at its LOD. An almost 6.5% drop on pre-CPI day for the VIX is really incredible and just shows how much bull hopium this market is holding onto right now‚Ä¶ \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nHonestly today was terrible day‚Ä¶ I even called on Friday in my TA that we would likely close 410-414 area today‚Ä¶ and well it happened and I didn‚Äôt believe it the whole way up‚Ä¶ The red futures open and the huge VIX drop today threw me off and I kept waiting after the massive bull push this morning for a bigger drop that never came. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jwt43mcw0ia1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff03ed619f5db038983490c8d9274c2e82aa81f4\n\nThe other issue is that because IV/ premiums are so high right now I kept talking myself out of calls saying ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt enough upside to warrant this play‚Äù and then it would push up and I could had 5-10% a few different times. \n\nDefinitely not my best trading day today‚Ä¶ I look forward to CPI being over tomorrow and seeing what this market wants to do‚Ä¶ If we get a lower CPI and markets receive it well honestly I have little doubt that this bull run doesn‚Äôt continue‚Ä¶ outside of a black swan there just wouldn‚Äôt be anything in my opinion to cause people to sell‚Ä¶ \n\nRealistically for me unless we get a hotter than expected CPI/ CORE I  just don‚Äôt see what is going to stop this market right now‚Ä¶ JPOW couldn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ three of largest stocks all missing on the same day couldn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ FOMC couldn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ im really not sure what WILL do it‚Ä¶", "id": "111ke19", "created_utc": 1676323327.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4205|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Overall I think SPY is going to struggle to hold 407.3 (about 1.4%+) support tomorrow and likely head lower‚Ä¶ if we miss on CORE MoM I think this market really drops tomorrow‚Ä¶", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Everyone tomorrow: It's gotta be Calls or Puts!!!\n\nMarket tomorrow: F ur calls F ur puts (Straddle this MF'ers)", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "That would be a tragedy.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Shakesperean", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Theta gang always fucken winning", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "This did age well!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Market has priced in favorable CPI for next 10 months Lolol", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Getting there, few more pumps left", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "A few more PAMPS to 500", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "You are correct, inflation heating back up again is what will cause markets to break down. \n\nNew car pricing is still out of control.
