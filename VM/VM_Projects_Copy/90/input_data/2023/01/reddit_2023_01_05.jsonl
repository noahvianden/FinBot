{"title": "Buying Opportunity", "selftext": "Hey WallStreetBets,\n\nIt looks like Amazon is preparing for some tough times ahead, with the company taking out an $8 billion unsecured loan and reportedly planning for workforce reductions. While some may see this as a sign of trouble, I see it as a buying opportunity.\n\nYes, Amazon's stock dropped 50% last year and the macroeconomic environment is uncertain. But with peak inflation hopefully behind us and a consumer base that is still in good shape, I believe there's potential for an upside surprise in the near future. And who better to lead the company through these challenges than Jeff Bezos himself? It's been less than two years since he stepped down as CEO, and if Bob Iger can make a successful return to Disney, why not Bezos at Amazon?\n\nDon't let the short-term challenges discourage you. I believe Amazon has the potential to bounce back and take off in the coming year.\n\n\n[Amazon secures $8 billion term loan](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-secures-8-billion-loan-2023-01-03/)\n\n\n[Jeff Bezos may return to helm Amazon, says forecaster of double-digit stock market losses last year](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/this-analyst-who-forecast-a-double-digit-drop-in-stocks-for-2022-now-says-jeff-bezos-may-return-to-helm-amazon-11672832739)", "id": "1044yz1", "created_utc": 1672940448.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|6 days ago\n**Total Comments**|8|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bezos isnâ€™t coming back hes having too much fun sending dickpics to hoors and pretending to be a spaceman.", "score": 139, "replies": [{"body": "Elon and Bezos need to duke it out on Mars", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Bezos is ripped.
