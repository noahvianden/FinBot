At least Amazon has strong operating cash flows in it's early days, except for 1999-2001 (and 1996 as a start-up) when the company was spending heavily on marketing and fulfillment in addition to recognizing unearned revenue with the introduction of Prime. \n\nWhen you look at AMD‚Äôs 10-Q, earnings are rising, but operating cash flows is still negative, which suggests poor earnings quality. Accounts receivable is up $664 million, suggesting customers are purchasing heavily on credit. Then you see in their footnotes that $349 million of AR is unbilled revenue that's been recognized, as in no invoice sent to customer yet, but that‚Äôs still recognized revenue for them. This is explained by a recent accounting principle they adopted for accelerated revenue recognition, which would explain a lot of the rise in revenue... They also don't give a number for allowance for doubtful accounts, which is a reduction of accounts receivable and important for determining how often their customers are able to pay their debts. However, AMD just says it's there in the last 10-K, even though they say AR, net, without giving a number on how it‚Äôs estimated, just that it‚Äôs based on ‚Äúexperience.‚Äù It raises question like: how often does a person not pay them? Are they ever too lax on credit? Do they ever recognize bad debt expense? How good are their debt collection methods? Is AMD actually getting that revenue or is the company faking it? \n\nSomething doesn't smell right.
