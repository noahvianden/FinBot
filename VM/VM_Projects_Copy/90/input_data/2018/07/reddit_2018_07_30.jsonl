I also thought trying to chart something like an index was even less worthwhile.\n\nI have googled “does charting work for trading” and I’ve read multiple articles hosted by The Street, CNBC, CNN money (so not just seeking alpha) and some of these folks have apparently been able to make predictions and then follow up with actual results, and some had success in the 65% range, and some over 80%, even on things like SP and NQ.  This wasn’t remotely a statistical study, 4 different studies with between 6 and 10 predictions each, doesn’t provide enough data.  At the same time from other decent/good sources it reads “sometimes useful”.\n\nSo what I really want to know is: what’s your success rate, both for calling targets and for investing?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Charting is essentially just a visual representation of the psychology of market participants.
