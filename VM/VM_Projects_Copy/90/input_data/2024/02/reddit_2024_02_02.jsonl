Meta keeps getting touted as this stock that dropped purely on doomer talk, but the reality is the financials and outlook were terrible at the time and the drop was completely warranted. Hindsight is always 20/20, but take a look at what was actually happening when it fell. Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2022 were the first time in history Meta saw revenue shrink YoY, and it literally happened 3 earnings in a row. Net income also got chopped by more than 50%, from ~$10B per quarter in 2021 down to $4.5B per quarter in the bottom of 2022.\n\nThat’s a brutal year for a high flying tech stock. And financial outlook through most of 2022 was incredibly bearish as well. Apple’s new privacy features destroyed Meta’s ability to collect user data as easily, and TikTok was solidifying itself as an app that the younger generation was using more than Instagram. As a result, the stock price dropped back to earth. If it hadn’t then the company would’ve had a PE of ~50, which again is just ridiculous to pay for a stock that has shrinking revenue, margins, and profit. \n\nAs they’ve continued to put out good ERs over the past year, the stock has been steadily rising. That’s just the nature of the market. I don’t think there was “obvious” signs they were going to pivot so successfully. Most people commenting as such just got lucky and like to boast. Look at stocks like PayPal or Alibaba as what could’ve happened to Meta. Just years and years of declining price even despite the underlying fundamentals improving. Very few ppl will ever agree with that sentiment though. It’s far easier to just bash stocks as they’re falling and praise them as they’re rising and never make predictions. Everyone says “I told you so” but none of them actually have posts where they initially called it out. \n\nMy $0.02 anyway.", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "Good commentary.

I’m not bearish on meta, and the very first sentence of my post literally says that. What I’m saying is the numbers justified the drop, the same way the numbers now justify the growth. If you’re a long term investor it was just noise, but in the short term it was horrific.\n\nI’m not sure which margin you’re talking about, as their operating margin plummeted from 40% in 2021 to 25% in 2022. And their profit margin fell from 35% to 20%. The economy was growing while revenue was shrinking and Zuck stopped issuing forward guidance so investors had no idea how long they’d be in a rut. Getting down to a PE of 8 isn’t particularly cheap for a company that’s actively ruining its top and bottom line. \n\nIn the most recent Q, and for all of 2023, margins and revenue have gone back up. They literally made $14B profit in Q4 2023 vs $4.6B a year ago. That’s a 3x improvement YoY. Again, I like the stock, but I’m holding long term. People claiming it was so “obvious” to buy at $90 are mostly wannabe Warren Buffetts using hindsight.
