{"title": "Secret projects Apple is working on over the next 10 years:", "selftext": "Some people think Apple will slow down in terms of growth. I don't, in fact I think most investors are sleeping on how much expansion Apple is due for in the coming years.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nApple's R&D budget is insane. $21 billion dollars invested into research and development last year alone and if trends continue that number will only rise. \n\nIn any of these new markets they\u2019re expanding into, they won't be the first. An important thesis of my argument is that that's a good thing. When you look at their product history, whether it was the iPod, iPhone, Airpods, Mac, etc. It's always just been a more refined and unified version of the best product on the market at the time. Thanks to their brand loyalty and heavy focus on R&D they can afford to wait out other companies and enter products fields much later than others. Therefore the expansion I think they're taking most seriously is in virtual reality, EV's, and healthcare. Those first two fields in my eyes would be a guaranteed success, but as I'll get into later depending on what direction they go healthcare may be a bigger obstacle. \n\n***Augmented and Virtual Reality:*** Apple Glasses and Apple VR seem to be not too far in the future. [This](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/) article says Apple is working a headset with augmented AND virtual reality, which is way different than the current Occulus Quest. While I think Meta will eventually come out a very impressive headset, considering the negative sentiment around Meta and how out of touch they are with consumers, I see companies like Apple and Microsoft building on what Meta created and making Occulus irrelevant. Apple VR could be the first headset purchase for a lot of people.   \n\n***The Apple Car:*** It definitely exists, and it might not dust Tesla, but definitely won't be bad and it'll probably make meme companies like Lucid, NIO, and Rivian obsolete (because who in their right mind would value a company 90 times above their earning without seeing a working vehicle yet). Also Elon Musk pretty much laughed in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjuwpcEfkSI) when the reporter asked whether they're taking the Apple Car seriously. He said of course they are, Apple's stealing valuable engineers away from him. The real question can Apple make this car affordable and not sell the tires separately from the car?\n\n***Healthcare:*** Here's where things could get tricky. Amazon, JP-Morgan, and Berkshire Hathaway already tried to do healthcare with a company called Haven, and it failed after 3 years. If those guys couldn't figure it out, I'll be honest there's not much confidence for Apple. The only part of me that thinks this could be something different is that the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook has repeatedly [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHUz63xFyyw) that Apple's biggest contribution to mankind WILL be through healthcare. In this piece from the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-struggles-in-push-to-make-healthcare-greatest-legacy-11623832200), Apple has really envisioned a future in healthcare. They\u2019ve said they're working towards more subscription revenue through health-monitoring services with the Apple Watch, with their end goal being eventually primary care services with Apple employed doctors at their own clinics. All I'm saying is Apple has the money and they have the people, and if I HAD to bet on one of the big tech companies breaking into healthcare, I'd probably bet on Apple.\n\nThey also still have room to grow with Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay which are all recurring subscription revenue that grew 32.9% compared to last quarter, which more importantly is only 21% percent of their total revenue. iPhones, Macs, and accessories are still growing at a monstrous pace in Asia, especially in China and Japan. And they've done very well at dodging controversy. So whatever Apple releases next, I'm sure a lot of people will buy it. Consumers are gonna keep adding Apple products to their ecosystem of Apple devices and Apple is gonna keep growing and keep growing and keep growing.", "id": "pxlo3s", "created_utc": 1632881877.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "I hope they make some hearing aids because their audio tech is way better than Phonak and other hearing aid companies", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4803561866283417}, {"body": "Healthcare?

Even with Apple, who are so great with execution most of the time.\n\nThe way I see it, Apple could do a lot with these projects, and I trust them more than most other companies that they know what they're doing. I'm excited to see which other industries they can disrupt the way they did with iPhone or many other products. But it's definitely not guaranteed they will succeed.

They are the only large platform shift that was in many ways, simple and easy, at least compared to others.

If it did, then you'd be able to throw objects to stun enemies, maybe knock a Combine over with a chair to get the edge on them, or even face off in a 1-1 melee fight where you nudge his arm to make him pull his gun back on himself, and then you physically press the trigger.\n\n> I won't even bother with multiplayer as an argument because that can easily demolish any discussion toward VR.\n\nWhy not bring that up? Multiplayer in VR is a perfect example of how increased player agency can lead to more dynamics between players, such as being able to toss ammo, steel ammo, use call out signs with your hands without alerting people etc.\n\n> VR is NOT NEW by any means and like i mentioned elsewhere, it's as gimmicky as 3d cinema.\n\nIf it's not new by any means, then why does it provide new gameplay opportunities, new storytelling opportunities, new genres, and is able to redefine many genres or aspects of gaming (like multiplayer, which is totally redefined in VR due to social presence).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Why not bring that up\n\nBecause any player with a regular computer can destroy any player in VR within the games we have and there isn't a way to compensate for it which wouldn't cripple the already existing gameplay.\n\n>If it's not new by any means, then why does it provide new gameplay opportunities, new storytelling opportunities, new genres, and is able to redefine many genres or aspects of gaming (like multiplayer, which is totally redefined in VR due to social presence).\n\nIt isn't and you're completely wrong and making ludicrous claims. Multiplayer social presence is exactly what has kept WoW alive for over a decade with astounding success: many players made friends, wives and husbands as well as interact in ways the original developers may have never intended. MP Social games have existed for as long as the internet did.

Multiplayer VR games will almost always be VR-only.\n\n>  Multiplayer social presence is exactly what has kept WoW alive for over a decade with astounding success\n\nThere's a difference between your definition of social presence and mine. I know what you're talking about, because I met an ex in an MMO before, so of course you can create incredibly deep relationships like this. Yet we did not experience social presence with each other, because we were both separated by a 2D screen.\n\nSocial presence is the feeling of being in physical proximity to someone else. There's a fundamental difference between:\n\n- Having two animated characters with text/voice being utilized, separated by a 2D screen\n\n- Having two people who perceive each other as being right in front of them, and not separated by a 2D screen, with voice/body language being utilized and no need to rely on pre-canned animations.\n\nOne of the most impressive social dynamics I've ever seen in an MMO is the A Stage Reborn stage plays from FFXIV. It's amazing what that team accomplishes, but it is still at the end of the day, a scripted event using scripted animations.\n\nIn VR, I have been a part of a stage play before where nothing is scripted - it's all made up in real-time using real body language.\n\nIs there nothing innovative about this? What about if we focus more on pure gameplay with a game like Echo VR, where you can utilize fakeouts based on your real body language to trick opponents, and just overall have a level of manoeuvrability in 3D space that couldn't ever be possible without VR.
