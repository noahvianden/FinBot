{"title": "NVDA (and possibly AMD) is screwed for Q2 Earnings", "selftext": "First off, we all love NVDA and it's an amazing meme stock.  A lot of us have made countless amounts of money off of these guys.  But for Q2 earnings they're fucked.\n\n1: Take a look at these [GPU price graphs](https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/video-card/).  The trend is a huge peak and slow fall, but all of this happened before Q1 earnings, meaning their large beat in may was heavily influenced by this.  Since the beginning of february GPU prices are 30% lower.  Due to the law of supply and demand, this means that the supply was too high and the demand fell - meaning NVDA lost money on a lot of these cards.  A price drop at this scale means a large excess of inventory - i'll get to that later.\n\n2: Cryptocurrency fad is dead for the time being.  The following is a quote from their CFO about cryptocurrency (which NVDA does not like to talk about):\n> \u201cCryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million,\u201d Kress said. \u201cLooking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level.\u201d\n\nSince Nvidia's total revenue was [$3.207 billion](https://s22.q4cdn.com/364334381/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2019/NVIDIA-Q1Y19-Form-10Q.pdf) in the first quarter, this means a 7% drop in revenue Q/Q due to only cryptocurrency.\n\n3: [Gigabyte, a company which makes NVDA cards saw their revenue fall 30% in june.](http://emops.twse.com.tw/server-java/t05st10_e?TYPEK=sii&step=show&co_id=2376&year=2018&month=06) This is the most direct evidence revenues are going to massively fall, as this was right when graphics cards saw a huge price drop.  \n\n4: [Allegedly there was an OEM who returned 300,000 GPUs back to Nvidia.](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-oem-partner-300k-gpu-inventory-issues-next-gen-geforce-delay/)  If this is true that is around $150 million in revenue lost assuming an average price of $400 per card (really rough estimate).  That's another 7% meaning these two things combined could show a 14% loss in revenue Q/Q.  This shows another instance of inventory mismanagement on NVDA's part.\n\nAll in all NVDA could see a large drop in earnings.  Due to the nature of this stock, however, there's no telling if it actually goes down after earnings.  If AMD earnings come out bad that will prove some of these points and give you a warning as to what NVDA earnings hold, so I suggest watching AMD if you will play NVDA.\n\n-\n\nTL;DR: NVDA made too many cards cause of crypto or something else, GPU prices are down, and their earnings are fucked.", "id": "8yh106", "created_utc": 1531457099.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Nvdia doesn't profit from the insane retail prices.
