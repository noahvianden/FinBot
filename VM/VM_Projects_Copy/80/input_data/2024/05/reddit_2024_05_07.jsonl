{"title": "is TSLA potentially the \"American\" Honda?", "selftext": "I think TSLA might be (or become) the American Honda. Good products, occasionally cool stuff - and a name everyone knows.\n\nI think TSLA will eventually be something like Honda. Tesla is American, born and supported in primarily in the US.\n\nHonda is a great company. They make lots of great products. Honda makes vehicles, cars, aircraft, motorcycles, boat motors, lawn mowers, and a Robot (ASIMO the humanoid robot) and a motor that competes well in Formula-1 racing. So, I see parallels to TSLA.\n\nTesla has great products: Vehicles, Solar and battery products, and charging. Eventually maybe taxis that drive themselves and/or a robot.\n\nThat said, adoption can be slow and competition is often stiff. Tesla will do a good job of competition, but I can't see where they have a monopoly or even close. Even if Cathie Wood bases her TSLA predictions on monopoly or near cornered market estimates.\n\nI read on this reddit and post reply here and there.\n\nI have small put options on both TSLA. I think the auto industry is headed for a slower clip in the near future.\n\nI maintain that TSLA will be priced like a car company with some tech in the mix. Like Honda, but with more automation. Clearly with the number of people being cut from the company management knows things are slowing down. My opinion leans on the P/E ratio. The S&P 500 P/E ratio has roughly been between 15 and 25 for the last 15 years. I think TSLA is headed for a 25-35 x P/E. It is where tech some companies which make things are sitting. AAPL 28x, MSFT 35x, GOOG 26x, META 26x, TM (Toyota) is at 10x, Honda is at about 9x or 10x. TSLA is a vehicle company right now. The charging stations are a real business that seems to have longevity. And I think down the road TSLA will have material products for automation. The automatons ‚Äì cars and robots are neat, but having a real product for market seems way off. And TSLA won‚Äôt be the only one.\n\nReal products to market have often been slow to Musk and TSLA. Musk said the Cybertruck would go into production in late 2021 back when the vehicle was revealed in 2019. A small number of deliveries were made in late 2023. This was 4 to 5 years after announced. It is clear that planned products do happen, but often years after announced.\n\nAs the markets where TSLA has products become more mature, the growth prospects for the company become smaller. Sure TSLA could release a windmill, robot, something closer to real FSD, or Model X that tweets various videos of things that happen while driving, but things look like TSLA is maturing. Right now things are pivoting to a more stable and mature TSLA. And with a new product maybe it gets into the 40s maybe even the 50s. But this good company looks like the stock is overvalued. For my investments, I see TSLA headed to a PE between 25 and 35. And I think its going to get there this year and stay in that range for a while.
