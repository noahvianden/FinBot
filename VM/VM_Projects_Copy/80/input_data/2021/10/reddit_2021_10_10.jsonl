If they can sell every car they make in the US for a premium price because of a new tax credit, I don't think they are gonna bother with exporting to Latin America any time soon.\n\nIf Berlin ramps up, it's possible that Giga China has some extra supply to export, but that's gonna be too far away. At the same time, I am not sure if the demand from Latin America is high enough already to put a lot of effort in it for Tesla. I would assume (with no further knowledge) that the charging infrastructure is lacking and therefore you have a chicken/egg problem, Tesla has no interest in solving because their resources are better spend elsewhere for the moment.\n\nSo I would say it will take quite a while (>3-5 years), before they have the resources to build Superchagers and have enough supply to ship to South America, at an attractive price point.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate your insight.

Tesla's expansion rate is incredible, but the pent up demand is insane. I cannot see LICE manufacturers catching up anytime soon. In my view, the only EVs others will sell for the next 5 years will be to people who simply can't, or won't, wait for the Tesla they want. That will leave them with a bad taste for the dealers who rip them off while forcing them to buy inferior product. $10,000 mark up on Mach E anyone? OK, slight exaggeration, people will buy Lightnings, Silverados, Rivians, etc, because they can't stomach the Cybertruck, but at some point Tesla will build a smaller, more conventional pickup, or a van that can do the job.
