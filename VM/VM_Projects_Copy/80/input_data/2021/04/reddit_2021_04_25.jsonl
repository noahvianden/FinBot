{"title": "Is Tesla IV Low Going Into Earnings (Should you be buying options here)?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n# I recently came across a post on this subreddit where the author was asking \"Is TSLA IV suspiciously low before Q1 ER\"?\n\nI took a look at the numbers for him and while it *appears* to be low on the surface, it is actually not. Let me explain.\n\nIf we just look at the implied volatility for TSLA, we see this that it is low compared to the past. Infact, if we plot the Vol Cone for TSLA, we see that we are way below the level of volatility we would typically see for the stock.\n\n[https://imgur.com/m6R4ZWt](https://imgur.com/m6R4ZWt)\n\nYou can see that we are basically at the lowest volatility across the chain. (I am happy to answer questions about the volatility cone if it is not clear how it works).\n\n# Now the important question to ask is this:\n\nwhy is the implied volatility \"low\", and does this mean options are cheap going into earnings?\n\nThe reason volatility appears low is because we have just come out of an extremely high volatility environment. Think about it like this:\n\n\"We just got off the highway, and now we are driving on a normal road. It feels like we are going slow, even though we are actually at a normal speed. It feels slow because a moment ago we were going much quicker\".\n\nUnder normal circumstances, VIX at 17 is still high. Remember, VIX was at 12 prior to covid.\n\nSO! IV is just looking low *relative* to the craziness of the last year.\n\n# \"So what about the earnings? Shouldn't I still buy options here?\"\n\nYou always can. But the question is, are the options a good price? Here's what we need to do to find out.\n\nThe options have exposure to more than just the earnings. It has exposure to market volatility, non event volatility, and event volatility.\n\nThe cool thing is that the market implies a move around earnings in the options. We can actually isolate this and know what the market is saying.\n\nSo the real question to ask if we want to buy options to bet on an earnings event is this:\n\nDo we think the market implied move is low or high?\n\nHere's some numbers for TSLA.\n\n[https://imgur.com/TgKgCSP](https://imgur.com/TgKgCSP)\n\nAs you can see, **even though the IV looks low, it's  implying a bigger move than what it realizes, and only slightly less than what it implies on average!**\n\n# So the options actually look a bit expensive, not cheap.\n\nEspecially as you dig deeper (perhaps ill save this for another post)\n\nI hope this post has made it clear that looks can be deceiving right now.

I never hear people say that, because the odds are stacked in the casino’s favor. If you trade options right you can be the casino and not the gambler.

Its not, because the implied move baked into the options is the same as before.\n\nEven if the implied move is the same as before, the premium for that risk has decreased. It is cheaper. That's a fact.\n\n1. it looks cheap because non event vol is coming down. its low \"relative\" to a year ago. But its not low in the grand scheme of things.\n\nNon even volatility is a measure of overall market volatility and affects premium for individual events as well. In a high non-even volatility, MMs demand a higher premium in general. In a lower non-event volatility, MMs will ask for less premiums. The same tesla event in the context of a higher general IV environment (months ago) would garner higher premiums then and for the same reason is garnering less premium now.\n\nThis is all basics 101 options stuff.
