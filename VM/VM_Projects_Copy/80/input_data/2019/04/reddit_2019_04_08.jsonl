Don’t get me wrong I’m sure some where a country possibly has its own special version of a Cessna, but commercial jets have to be made in mind that it can cross international borders and still be “legal”, because planes are certified to the international standard as agreed to by the FAA and the European counterpart. \n\nFor example, let’s say Mexico has less strict smog laws, now Ford wants to save some money in Mexico so Ford uses a cheaper NOX filter system in Mexico because the laws don’t require Ford to buy the more expensive system. When that Mexican Ford crosses into the US it is technically illegal because it would fail a US smog check. \n\nBut with commercial jet liners you have to make the plane with respect to the international standard, but you can’t regulate the plane to such a high degree in each country that severely hampers Boeing’s ability to make a plane. How it works is that the FAA certifies Boeing, and the European agencies using the FAA guidelines certify the Boeing aircraft in their country. Likewise the European agencies certify airbus and the FAA uses the European certifications to certify repair jobs on airbuses in the US. For the most part the plane companies regulate themselves but when regulation isn’t stringent enough any country’s regulator whether, European, American, Ethiopian will work with Boeing to make sure those kinds of problems never happen again.
