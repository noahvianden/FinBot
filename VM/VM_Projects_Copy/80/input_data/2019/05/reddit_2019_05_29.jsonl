But anecdotes aren't evidence....", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yo I was actually typing a really long comment for you after looking closely into Tesla's 10-Q, but stopped halfway because I thought you wouldn't read it. However, you said the magic words, FRA practice is good CFA Level 2 practice and I love you too. \n\nLet's take a look at Tesla's statement of cash flows from Q1, many strange choices. I'll preface this with the fact that dramatic accounting choices are generally suspect. \n\n>Operating cash flow related to repayment of discounted convertible notes = -$188.1 million. \n\nDoesn't matter if you put a few extra words in front of it, it's supposed to be a financing activity since it's repayment of debt. \n\n>Inventory write downs= +80 million. \n\nTesla's stated that this is only done for forecasted lack of demand. This writedown is almost as much as what Tesla claimed last year. Suspect for sure, either there will be less demand, or they're trying to improve their efficiency ratios past a threshold that will be picked up on, like a Beneish model or Altman Z-score. It for sure gives the appearance of better operating cashflow. Also 10% of the book value of inventory.\n\n>Other non-current assets= +28 million\n\nThat shouldn't be in operating activities. Tesla has never reported that on a financial statement in operating activities, that should be lumped into investing activities. One might think the increase in Goodwill matches but it doesn't.\n\nRepayments of borrowings issued to related parties= $0..., haven't repaid anything they borrowed recently, strange. \n\nIf you look at the VIE section, AR increased 11 million... when it \n\n>Deferred Revenue=+317 million. That's abnormally large, considering consumer deposits were falling, even though they started recognizing more pre-payments for service plans into customer deposits, so the negative balance could be related to deliveries and fulfillment of sales, but coupled with a shit ton of increased deferred revenue seems troubling, especially when Accounts receivable actually only rose 99 million, while inventory increased bigly, with a 809 million increase, only $200 million less than all of 2018. \n\nAlso this raises a red flag:\n\n>Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 was $37.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees, we expect to recognize $462.3 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the various performance periods of the obligations, which is up to the eight-year life of the vehicle.\n\nHold up, they only recognized $37.4 million this quarter, but they're going to recognize another 462.3 million... that's quite ambitious.\n\nCompared with Q3 of 2018\n>From the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2018, revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $60.3 million. Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees, we expect to recognize $284.7 million of revenue in the next 12 months. \n\nAdditonally, they have a new recognition standard, which already allowed them to realize revenue quicker, yet, they were not near so ambitious (see page 80 of 10-k).\n\nThen there's this piece in 2019Q1 which explains it the little boost they give themselves:\n\n>Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was $140.0 million and $0 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. We expect to recognize the deferred revenue as of March 31, 2019 over the **next 2 to 3 years.**\n\nCurrent assets and liabilities are supposed to be one year. Tesla, however, decided to take move it onto the balance sheet really early, effectively boosting OCF, even though cash has not been exchanged. \n\nAnd then there's adoption of ASC 842 to make themselves look even better for operating cash flows: \n\n>With the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program will be accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 and there will be no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements will be classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nResulted in a +13 million in OCF, compared to an operating line item that was a big negative flow on their prior OCFs.\n\nThose fuckers are up to something.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Hold up, they only recognized $37.4 million this quarter, but they're going to recognize another 462.3 million... that's quite ambitious.\n\nMarketWatch reported last August that changes in how revenue from leased vehicles with resale guarantees would be recognized under the new rules, based on advice that auditor PwC was giving clients, would likely result in Tesla’s top line suddenly looking much bigger.

Automotive leasing revenue is a different case and not relevant. The remaining balance is in reference to the resale value value guarantee, which is amortized overtime.

Whatever article you're referencing is wrong... \nHere is the full section. Nothing to do with leasing. \n\n>*Automotive Sales with and without Resale Value Guarantee*\n\n>Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation include access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates. Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee amounted to $1.04 billion and $882.8 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 was $37.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees, we expect to recognize $462.3 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the various performance periods of the obligations, which is up to the eight-year life of the vehicle.\n\n>At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there will be changes to future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the three months ended March 31, 2019, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options. As a result, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $500.5 million. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a corresponding reduction in automotive cost of sales of $408.8 million. The net impact was $91.7 million reduction in gross profit.\n\nPage 9 on the 10-Q\n\nHere is what you're talking about. \n\n>Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option\n\n>We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the United States. These transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles has not been transferred, these transactions were accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. **Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised. For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases, we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.\n\n>In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory.\n\nWhat you're talking about is related to this on the most recent 10-Q. \n\n>We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the United States.
