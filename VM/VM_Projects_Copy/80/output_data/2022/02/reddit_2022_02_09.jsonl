It's more nuanced, it's not all hedge funds. Actually, hedge funds come and go all the time, I think they have some absurd  \nfailure rate as many do poorly unless they have something that gives them a particular edge/alpha. What you are actually referring to when you say hedge funds is institutional market makers, which there are only a handful. As their name implies, they are there to make a market, to serve both sell side and buy side. This is where the fluctuations happen. Sure, for the average person, MSFT moving up one day a certain amount and then going down a certain amount the next might seem pointless, but the fact is whenever the market is open, there are ideas of what an asset should be bought/sold for. Imagine a bazaar, with throngs of people, not everyone may actually buy or sell for the same price.   \nA market is living and constantly changing. One person might be willing to buy at one price given one piece of info, another might be willing to sell given some other piece of info. And so  \nmarket makers facilitate this, and \"wall street\" moves up and down. These days, some institutions use algorithms which buy/sell at fast speeds, but the market is really a large amorphous entity which is why I put wall street in quotes, because you are also taking part in that market. So is CALPERS, California's largest pension fund, so is Billy huangs family fund or buffets, or some basement quant fund started by some MIT grads. The market has participants from all over. A large portion of the money is in fact institutional yes, but  \nthese institutions can vary, and not all are market makers. Edward Jones managing money for a large pool of HNW clients is considered an institution, so is JP Morgan, a major investment bank. You have Blackrock, which packages up all sorts of ETFS for people to buy (and also was tapped by the Fed for the Feds bond purchases early in 2020), who is also considered an institution. The market is very diverse is what I'm getting at, and everyone has a different idea of what is considered fair market value for an asset. With all these diverse opinions, every participant has the same goal, sell something for more than you bought it at. That's why stocks move everyday. Because a market is being made, and supply/demand kicks in for pricing, some people aim for short term gains and scalps, to the microsecond if it's a quant fund, others on a different time horizon. And that's just equities, the same happens across the commodities floor (mostly digital now but used to be a pit at the CBOE), or the bond market, or the currency market. I think the scale at which the financial markets span is really hard for many people to comprehend.

You retards have just become the largest cliqu\u00e9 of confident fools in the world. You just follow whatever meme wave is going on, without taking half a second considering how to actually make money. This meta shit is the equivalent of thinking with your cock to make investments.\n\nI have not heard a single good justification for Meta being at the price it is at. At the price it is currently at, you would think people are expecting a meteor to hit their headquarters. They had slightly subpar quarter and FB daily user numbers are starting to plateau, most likely due to the fact that 1 third of the \\*\\*WORLD POPULATION\\*\\* is already a daily user. What's driving the stock down right now is purely panic, hatred and other emotions you would expect from a teenage girl that just had her first period. Congratulations on being a part of that, btw.\n\nMeta is a powerhouse conglomerate with multiple pivoting possibilities, political connections, vaults of backup balance and cutting edge R&D teams made up of the most wicked IT virgins on earth. They have some of the best AI tech in the world, next to Google, and they are, like it or not, currently the biggest player in the VR industry. Biggest of all though, they own all the fucking data. They know how many times you jerk of to tranny porn everyday. They know how many anal fissures your father got last year from getting pegged, and I fucking promise you, those things are not anywhere NEAR the most interesting of things they gather on a daily basis.\n\nDo you guys really believe for one second, that any and all governments aren't jizzing their pants in ecstasy over the fact that they get to have access to all of this sweet, juicy, data?\n\nEurope is calling the most desperate bluff, ever, when they say they don't care. It's like when that kid in highschool got called gross by the popular girl and then starts pretending like he doesn't care \"I don't like her anyway, haha, she's just a bitch anyway, haha...\". They only pull shit like that, because they know Meta \\*\\*won't\\*\\* pull out of Europe, but if Zuck actually had the cojones to go all the fucking way, Macron and Merkel would, without a fucking doubt, eat their own excrement on live television and then apologize to lord Facebook for their insolence, just to keep the social media they know they can access in their nations. It's a move to make people believe the EU is actually confident and powerful enough to stand up to corporations, but when it comes to the bottom-line, they are really kind of their bitch.\n\nAnd please don't hit me with that \"TikTok is the new social media standard, it is going to replace Meta\". First off, TikTok is Chineese, and doesn't give the western governments anything that resembles what Meta offers when it comes to international political advantages or intelligence. With TikTok all data goes to China and kinda fucking stays there. There's a reason why it was nearly banned in the US. TikTok is in a sense a modern day trojan horse, don't kid yourself. Second off, TikTok is gay. Kids are kids, and will like stupid kid shit. I liked Minecraft when I was between the ages of 9 and 13. Do I like Minecraft now? No, it is stupid gay shit. TikTok just can't replace Instagram or Facebook. TikTok is just a mobile dopamine machine, with zero actual practicality. You seem to forget that Instagram is actually essential for some businesses marketing, and Facebook can be essential for selling reused items locally, which is actually some peoples job. I know things like \"Marketing\" and \"Working\" are pretty foreign concepts if you're the type of person that eats croutons directly out of your navel and then calls it 'dinner', but it's for real guys, it's not something that just exists in movies.\n\nIf you are selling this or investing all of your money in puts at this price, you should really have your personal guardian monitor your finances for you. Going short or buying naked puts on Meta, is the biggest emotional play ever. It's almost bipolar. The 26% drop was already monumental, do you guys seriously expect that they will go bankrupt? Are all of you collectively this daft? They still grew this year and they will certainly continue growing. the only reason their earnings per share don't look phenomenal to someone who is illiterate in finances, is because they have put dialed the development on Metaverse into overdrive. They aren't slowing down, they're just fucking re-investing instead of hoarding, to avoid the drop in revenue from Facebook that is expected to become a problem 2 to 4 years down the line. It's funny because other small shitty companies that focus on growth with negative net income for 5 years + growing liabilities, will usually cause all of you retards to drop your life savings into call options that expires tomorrow.\n\n\"durrhh \\*\\*ITS GROWTH STOCK, NO WORRIES\\*\\* \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\"\n\nAll that said, the market is never really rational, and Meta might actually hit 200. So I did the smart thing. 100 Long @ 230 with 2 protected 200 puts @ 4.6 for 3/18. I believe some of you will probably make money with your puts, and you will obviously post your gains, most likely convincing some poor fucking idiots, that you are actually correct about Meta. These unfortunate fuckers will then go all in on puts out of FOMO and then subsequently get shit on from every thinkable angle. Good luck explaining to your parents how you lost your entire trust fund betting against the largest social media company in the world.\n\nNow, knowing WSB you will probably all call me gay for Zuckerberg or some other predictable shit, so go the fuck ahead.
