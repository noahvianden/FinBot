{"title": "Covered Calls as Part of a Long Portfolio", "selftext": "I am not a trader but an investor. This is more a general post for comment. In this post I share about how options work in tandem with my overall portfolio.  It is about 20% cash, 100% long on stocks and 20% short (net overall) on options, quite often covered calls showing negative value on aggressively moving stocks.\n\nCovered Calls (CCs) are a big part of  my approach. I use CCs to squeeze more juice out of my returns. It is my \"go to\" options move, but I am mostly in uncovered or long positions in stocks. Maybe 30% of the names will be in covered calls at a given time, but I usually invest in uncovered shares alongside the covered positions, so even here I participate in the upside.\n\nOne issue is I am constantly rolling each month. But the approach has worked the past few years. My portfolio started at about 300K in 2004 when I consolidated my and my wife's 403(b)s, began using brokerage, later options, and is now more than 10X over a 16-year period.\n\nI now own over 150+ stocks (I tend to buy and hold) but recommend to anyone starting out holding at least 20 stocks at however small the overall value, ideally 50. Let's say 50 stocks at 2K each for a 100K portfolio, or 20 stocks at $500 each for a 10K portfolio.  To do CCs, some positions will have to be larger but you get the idea.\n\nSo it is impossible to write covered calls unless you own 100 shares of something.  So maybe this approach only works as your portfolio grows given share prices, but there are quite a few names out there (ZUO, ZNGA, SPCE)  that trade under $50, so you would need some capital to get this going.\n\nFor CCs, I want to take advantage of premium when IV is high, and not monitor time decay on a daily basis, so I tend to go out 4-7 months (which is conservative, I know, but I have had FT jobs so I can manage my investments PT), and seek 15% ROI (per 6 months) including more volatile stocks that can get me 20 to 25% ROI of premium (using strike/strike-premium) in six months. This means that I am writing against some names that may go way up or down. That is against the convention I understand. Most Rx are to write CCs on slow moving yet bullish stocks. Either way, I start paying closest attention come 1 month out before rolling time.\n\nWhen I set up the CCs, I usually write ATM or a little above, OTM at 1 or 2 strikes higher. Not afraid of being near .55 to .65 delta since premiums are higher. If it's very volatile, sometimes I open ITM and sacrifice ROI potential, but lock in a solid return at a lower risk.\n\nThe issue I often face is when the stock runs away on me come expiration. I would like to share more about how to deal with this situation in another post. I have evolved some creative ideas to rescue these positions using wide spreads if I am still am bullish on the stock. It is often cheaper than buying more of my targeted stocks at current prices.\n\nEven if it's ITM when set up, it can easily be assigned upon expiry if it closes ITM. It all depends on what happens with the underlying price by expiration. Sometimes there is ex-dividend date announced the last month and I will close or roll before to avoid being assigned. It is important to track your break-evens and your expected ROIs on each call you write assuming it will be assigned. It is basically the strike price divided by the break-even (minus 1). This will help in future decision-making and rolling moves.\n\nSince I can't control the future, I set my ROI at a minimum of 15% (per 6 months) and am indifferent to what happens in terms of owning or being assigned. I only use stocks that I would not mind owning over the long term, such as cloud stocks or other tech stocks or even small companies, and some stable companies recommended by a service I use. I am prepared to hold some of these from 3 to 5 years or longer. Sometimes I close or roll early, but not usually since I want the time value to be low or gone when I roll.\n\nSometimes I enter into \"buy writes\" to set up a new position with a CC, especially if it is trading high vs the 20 day EMA or 50 day SMA. I have learned to add additional (10-20) uncovered shares ASAP to build my position, or shortly after opening, so I can also participate in upside on high flyers. I like to keep a nice cash reserve (near 20%) so I can also buy on dips. Ideally will have 200 long held shares and only 1 CC per stock using this approach. Maybe a add written put if the stock is trading in a defined range and IV is high. I only trade or speculate when I am willing to lose my entire position.  So I am not talking about short-term plays.\n\nI prefer covered calls over written puts covered by cash. This protects against a sharp downward move (such as Feb 2020), and margin calls, though I will sprinkle in a few written puts (OTM) if I want to buy at a lower price or stock is moving sideways.\n\nRolling is a whole subject that we can discuss in other posts. Rule of thumb is to earn a minimum of 1% per month on your incremental capital or no go. Divide your ROI by the number of months of the investment. Try to roll for a credit, but sometimes it is OK to invest more (roll for a debit) for a higher overall profit, albeit lower monthly ROI, especially if the strike is less than 80% of the stock.  Credits will reduce your B/E and debits will increase them, but for high-flyers, no problem.\n\nIn addition to CCs, I also like to use debit spreads (with over 100% ROI) on names I am excited about, and also synthetic longs on stocks that have a bullish one- or two-year time horizon (low capital, high ROI). I think the key is overall balance between targeting ROI via selling premium on CCs or spreads, and participating in simple upside on uncapped returns of a well-selected portfolio.\n\nMy investing has worked out well, and I have averaged over 16% per year for a 16-year period including the crash of 2008 (lost 86%) and other down years. I am pretty sure I will use CCs for income in retirement so will likely tone down the volatility of the underlying stocks over time and reduce the number of names I follow, and shorten the time to expiry.\n\nI think the key point on covered calls is that you have a capped upside, so it is not really an investment in the underlying, but you are leveraging the shares as collateral to earn premium. So I have a lot of stocks were I am not covered or partially covered since I am a long term investor and want upside too. Covered calls are capital intensive, and not really feasible on shares trading at too high a price, such as Amazon or MELI.  For highly priced shares, it might be good to build up using synthetic longs (combos of long calls and short puts ATM or near ATM).\n\nCovered calls allow me to have a total annual return of 2% to 10% above the market S&P return in a given year. I almost always beat the S&P with a well-diversified portfolio and a healthy dose of options, mostly CCs. Thanks to this approach, I feel my portfolio is fairly balanced between stocks and options, and look forward to becoming more selective/conservative as I approach retirement.\n\nAm I just lucky or does this make sense as a systematic approach to investing?

I think right now IV in a lot of names is incredibly high and can make these trades a no brainier even if there's a risk of a large draw down. \n\nTwo other suggestions I'd add:\n1. Sometimes I make shorter term or more aggressive trades in names I like. For example buying calls in a name I am long equity heading into ER. When these trades work I typically take a portion of the profit and invest it back into the underlying and so I essentially grow my share count with \"house money\". This can be a good way, even with CCs to move your share count from 100 to 200 so you can participate more in the upside like you mentioned, while psychologically silo'ing the risk so you don't feel you're risking fresh capital in a riskier name like a SPCE. \n\n2. This one is a bit contraversial right now with all the short squeeze mania happening, but I use \"Stock Yield Enhancement\" on IBKR. If you are unfamiliar, brokers only lend margined stock to short sellers, but certain brokers will allow you to opt in to lending your fully paid for stock and they split the interest with you. The main downside is you lose your voting rights on those shares if they are lent, but aside from that it functions essentially the same. So if you are holding a more volatile name like AMC, GME etc and selling CCs you can juice it a little more by allowing your shares to also be sold short.

Thought I\u2019d share here as I believe it shows a great buying opportunity for AMD especially in the next coming weeks.\n\n# Fundamentals:\n\nTheir latest ER:\n\n**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**\n\n**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**\n\nServer revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible.\n\nMassive increase in guidance. They\u2019re **expecting 37% growth** this year.\n\nSo why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let\u2019s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.\n\nObviously, we\u2019d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you\u2019re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, \u201chey we have too many orders and we can\u2019t keep up sorry, we\u2019ll get it to you ASAP\u201d\n\nImagine thinking this company isn\u2019t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.\n\nOur queen, Lisa Su, said \u201cthere will be added capacity\u201d in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they\u2019ll be good to go. I wouldn\u2019t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.\n\n**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**\n\nIntel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!\n\n**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.\n\n**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.\n\n# Technicals:\n\nFor those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.\n\nWe really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we\u2019re basically there right now.\n\nIn addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47\n\nFor more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.\n\n**Positions: 4/16/2021 100c, 97.5c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I am not a professional. **I just really like the stock.** \n\n* \n\n *My positions are **19 Feb 21 90c** as I expect a leg up next week or the following into the 95$ territory range (expected profit - 150% if it hits 95)\n\n*Buy stonks for a great long term hold as I expect this to probably moon to 130-140 range by EOY to early next year specifically near Q3-Q4 earnings.\n\n*Please discuss below", "id": "lenjhv", "created_utc": 1612708399.0, "score": 285, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Let's hope so.
