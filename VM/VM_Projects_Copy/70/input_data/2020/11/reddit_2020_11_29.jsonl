{"title": "Why you should be buying PCG", "selftext": "Look guys, there is sweet tendies to be had on these meme stocks and dont think for a damn second I am not feasting on them. But for the sake of diversification it doesnt hurt to look and see where there are more tendies to be had.\n\nPG&E Has had a rough ride but it is through the fire at this point. Pun intended. So Im gonna lay out some key reasonings as to why Im bullish on PCG and you should be too.\n\n1. They are a monopoly on power distribution in the most expensive places to live in the world.\n\n2. Before covid they were on the rise, because of the fires they have been left behind as every other stock is back to pre covid levels. This alone should be a massive bullish case\n\n3. Looking at the 52 week chart, **exactly one year ago PCG went on an absolutely insane bull run FROM $7 TO $18.** At some point this shit is gonna happen again.\n\n4. Hedge funds have been loading up on it.\n\n5. Fire season is over and they handled it perfectly, beyond that in they have an agreement with the state now where they will not be solely responsible for any fires.\n\n6. The inevitability of dividend reinstatement and the free reign they have to bring it back. In the bankruptcy agreement they agreed to not reinstate a dividend until 6 billion in non-GAAP earnings. What the fuck is non-GAAP? That means non generally accepted accounting principles. So they could literally make up any reason at any time, as to how they earned 6 billion dollars. ‚ÄúHey guys, every dollar we earned and got a loan for is earnings even though we didnt account for ITDA.‚Äù Nerds;‚ÄùHey PGE thats not generally accepted‚Äù PGE; ‚ÄúExactly you retards, why would you let us do this‚Äù.\n\nThe last point should be the most bullish case for PCG. Dividend reinstatement is inevitable and when it happens every single boomer retirement and pension fund is going to race into this shit. Before the first fire case it had a share price of $70. Once the dividend is back this shit will have a tesla level bull run.\n\nSo dont be a üåàüêª and fucking pump this shit up because if we can get some meme-mentum behind this it will be insane.\n\nBuy mostly LEAPS, yolo some shit on weeklys. This bitch is going to the moonüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ", "id": "k316k1", "created_utc": 1606616866.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "I was in for a taste at 10.16 for these same reasons.
