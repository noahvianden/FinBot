Im sure the data is out there somewhere, but I think it's obvious that the accident rate in a city where there is so much more going on is much higher than a highway where most of the time you just make small steering adjustments. I think this could account for a lot of that safety rate increase with AP. It will be interesting to see the numbers when AP for the city gets released.\n\n> The Nissan system is impressive for sure.

In a presentation or first party video you can talk about and show the best, while skipping the worst. This goes back to when you mentioned doing a bunch of takes to get that one perfect shot.

If a complete vision based artificial neural network driving system can't get closed to the performance of the  vision based neural network driving system in a human, then yeah. In that case it will stall out self driving development and we have to rely on hardcoded dumb logic, LIDAR, 3D mapping crutches that we've been trying to make work since 2010. \n\nI'm not super deep in AI, I took one elective master's course in machine learning, that's about it. But the reason those types of self driving cars haven't gotten anything done in 10 years is because they're dumb self driving cars. Tesla is trying to build a intelligent self driving car that can handle itself. \n\nI don't think the problem is hardware at all. Although it could be compute hardware, there's just so many pixels in an image to perform computation on. Our computers may not just be fast enough today. \n\nTesla FSD chip is decent. 74 TOPS, 8 GB RAM. A single GPU with 32GB of VRAM can train a 1.5 billion parameter model that fits in 3GB to run. That limits Tesla to like a 4 billion parameter model. State-of-the-art language models run 0.175 trillion parameter weights, compared to 100 trillion synaptic weights in the human brain. \n\nThe idea for Transformers in natural language processing was first introduced in 2017 and like GPT-2 with 1.5 billion parameters would generate something like this, \n\n [https://i.imgur.com/orUXZ3B.png](https://i.imgur.com/orUXZ3B.png) \n\nThis is now 3 years later when they published GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters, \n\n [https://i.imgur.com/6Dwrq5m.png](https://i.imgur.com/6Dwrq5m.png) (I ran this now)\n\nThat first model seems pretty crap at language compared to the second. If you imagine driving a car on a human level is just as complicated as natural language, then maybe you need a model on a similar size to that second example. At 175 billion param, just to fit that in RAM memory you would need about 350 GB of RAM to run it locally in a car. \n\nThat model really isn't perfect either, it will sometimes mess up some pretty basic logic and has a pretty bad attention span, like it kinda forgot it was even talking about Elon Musk or a song at the end there. Maybe creating an intelligent self driving car that can handle itself everywhere is like 2- 10 trillion parameters. It's going to take a couple years before computers get good enough to do that and self driving cars may just stall out for many years. \n\nThere's so much work left on architecture for image recognition and time series forecasting though, people haven't really figured out how to even use all the parameters in a good way. We don't really know if computers are fast enough to do self driving today, because we haven't really tried yet. Computers had a head start on AI. In natural language it took about 3 years after their killer idea for AI to cap out what today's computers are capable of. In time series forecasting/image recognition there's not really been any good easily scalable architecture yet. \n\nTCNs have started looking really good in recent months/year, maybe there's promise there, \n\n [https://towardsdatascience.com/temporal-convolutional-networks-the-next-revolution-for-time-series-8990af826567](https://towardsdatascience.com/temporal-convolutional-networks-the-next-revolution-for-time-series-8990af826567) \n\nUntil we really figure out the architecture, throw all the compute we have at the problem and see if cars start to drive themselves, we don't really know if it works or not. If it doesn't work and just needs way more compute, then we're stuck with dumb self driving cars like Waymo has, it's going to be slow gradual progress rolling out service, cities have to get designed with autonomy in mind, it's pretty lame.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I do not buy the \"LIDAR is a crutch\" argument, because why are radar and ultrasonics also not a crutch?
