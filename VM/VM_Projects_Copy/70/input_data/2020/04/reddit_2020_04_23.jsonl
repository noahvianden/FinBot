If you are at the right level of option trading in ToS, you can group your position statements by type. This shows your portfolio broken up into Single (puts, calls), Stock, Calendar spreads, Vertical spreads, etc. You can right click and sell the spread directly from that view.\n\nIf you are not at that level, then I think you can highlight both legs together, right click, and select Create Closing Trade.
