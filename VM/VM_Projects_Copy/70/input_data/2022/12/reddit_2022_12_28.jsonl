Yesterday TSLA was down 11.41%, marked the 7th consecutive red days, it’s probably due to the production cut of Shanghai factory in December and January. \n\n[TSLA trading volume daily](https://preview.redd.it/9rz5vxhsem8a1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=340ea96c85f70a03efe45735c97f3b7fe751767c)\n\nSince the start of December, TSLA is down 45% with increased volumed after mid-December. The trading volume of Tuesday is remarkable considering the subpar trading volume of the main indices.

But comparing the cars of TSLA competitors, TSLA cars are not attractive to me, they are not as competitive as it was couple years ago. If TSLA don’t come out with any new models or revise current models to be more competitive to their peers, the sales as well as the price of TSLA are going to decrease as the competition go intense. So personally, I don’t think this 91.52 support is enough to stop the downward momentum, if that support is broken, then the next support I am looking for is around 60.84.", "id": "zx6v36", "created_utc": 1672225350.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "Their cars have always been classic early adopter products.
