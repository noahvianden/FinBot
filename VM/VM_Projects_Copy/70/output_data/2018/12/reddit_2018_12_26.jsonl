After studying book summaries of The Intelligent Investor, the Little Book of Common Sense Investing, and a couple others; here is my advice to you. \n\nFirstly, markets have cycles. You and I have both been blessed to experience this downturn at the beginning of our journey, because it presents a buying opportunity. One thing is for sure, you definitely should not be selling. Instead you should be slowly averaging your money into the market. \n\nYou mention that your gains will be wiped for 1-2 years. Who cares about 1-2 years down the line? This is a 10-15 year game (30 years for me).. so just keep buying and after some years you\u2019ll be thankful for the low prices you took advantage of. \n\nThere\u2019s no way you can time the market. Don\u2019t join the rest of the fools trying to cash out and back in, because it\u2019s truly impossible to predict the bottom.

Fluctuations happen all of the time from -5% to +5%.\n\nIf you're watching a stock that has fundamentals that you believe in, and you know it well, you can consistently buy at -5% and sell at +5% without worrying about larger drops. Larger drops are only temporary, and with time you'll be positive again, provided that those fundamentals you believe in haven't changed.\n\nEx. Over the last few months, I've consistently bought AMZN at around 1530 and sold around 1760. I've done this about 3 or 4 times. The last time I bought at around 1500, I obviously got burned, but I haven't sold yet.
