{"title": "PYPL long-term Bull Thesis", "selftext": " What is up Retards, today I\u2019m going to be doing something a bit different from normal: a long-term bull thesis on an oversold growth company.\n\nWARNING: This is NOT a short term play, don\u2019t yolo your life savings into PYPL weeklies (I have other plays for that, stay tuned)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\n* Why Growth stocks have sold off\n* Is this an overcorrection?\n* Paypal Fundamentals\n* Strategic Acquisitions\n* Fair Value for Share Price\n* Positions\n* TLDR\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why Growth stocks have sold off:**\n\nRecently the market has been risk-off, where capital has been funneled into boring stable companies + bonds, and away from anything related to growth. There are reasons for this; future interest rate hikes and selling of bonds from the federal reserve, inflation, supply chain shocks, yield curve flattening, mounting recession risks, and the ongoing war in Ukraine causing commodity price imbalances.\n\nThe main cause is the federal reserve hiking interest rates and will be selling bonds. What this does is decrease the money supply which increases bond yields and interest rates. This makes future money LESS valuable using Discounted Cash Flow model ([DCF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp))\n\nThe DCF basically says that the value of future money is directly impacted by interest rates, and as interest rates increase, the value of future cash flow decreases relative to the value today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f026ocrnzkt81.jpg?width=5209&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5031bc4edd068842ca09ae3113fb1722c0d454d3\n\nThe Yield Curve is a forward looking indicator of the economy. It tracks the spread between the 10 yr and 2 yr treasury. What an inverted yield curve means is that investors are more pessimistic about the economy in the long run than in the short run. Inverted yield curves have pre-dated recessions every single time. (Note: a yield curve inversion does not necessarily mean a recession will happen.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcgnzvgpzkt81.png?width=1453&format=png&auto=webp&s=d62d72878a3d2c155bbc0432477c8f115aa92697\n\nAll those other situations mentioned will just make the fed hike interest rates further\n\nThis looks pretty bad\u2026 but much of this has already been priced into the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is this an Overcorrection?**\n\nShort answer: maybe\n\nLong Answer: On certain stocks this is definitely an overcorrection, PYPL being one of them\n\nOver the past 6 months, PYPL has gone down a whopping 62%! Nothing has fundamentally changed about their business model. In fact many of their core metrics have actually improved! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62h26ttqzkt81.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=276a7589417001d44a31d3f76e62c57ac8570a7b\n\nThis is basically unheard of for a company the size of PYPL, especially since nothing bad has happened besides macroeconomic outlook and hard Q/Q comps.\n\nThe loss of eBay in earnings metrics affects short term revenue growth, but won\u2019t hurt profitability in any way. By Q3, PYPL will not have Y/Y growth affected by eBay\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Paypal Fundamentals:**\n\nYr 2021:\n\nPYPL had 18.26% revenue growth despite 2020 being a record setting year\n\nOPEX only grew by 5.5%\n\nROCE (Return on Capital Employed) of 58%\n\n48.9M net new active accounts (NNAC)\n\nNon-GAAP EPS up 19%\n\nVenmo TPV grew 44%\n\n16.3B cash/cash equivalents\n\n9B debt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ4 2021:\n\n9.8M NNAC\n\n13% revenue growth (held back by the loss of ebay)\n\n426M total NNAC\n\nGAAP EPS up 49%\n\n22% TPV \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2022 forecasts:**\n\nQ1 is expected to be pretty bad due to the eBay situation, but excluding eBay, revenue growth will be around 14%+\n\nTotal 2022 growth will be around 15-17%, excluding eBay will be around 19-22%\n\nBy Q3, Q/Q growth will not be affected by eBay, making y/y growth figures look much better\n\nPYPL\u2019s P/E is around 28, which is virtually the lowest it has ever been. That is not much above the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 22, and almost none of those companies are growing at the rate PYPL is\n\nQ3-4 is set to beat earnings expectations out of the park and send this stock up once again\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions:**\n\nThere have been countless acquisitions made which set Paypal up to win in the fintech arena, both in consumer spending/transfers, business to business, and consumer to business.\n\nThe one that sticks out the most is Venmo, the 3rd most popular mobile Payment app. It has grown at a much faster rate than Paypal, and serves a niche which Paypal doesn\u2019t, quick and small transfers.\n\nThey have also acquired Paiday, a deferred Payment service which can be used for online purchases, and Honey, a web browser which finds coupons and has its own marketplace.\n\nThese along with other acquisitions, set PYPL up for dominating the future of online shopping, Payments, and transfers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fair Value for Share Price:**\n\nDue to the rapid growth in both FCF and revenue, and the future growth opportunities, I would put PYPL\u2019s fair value at $150. This would be around a 50% increase from today\u2019s price, and I could see PYPL reaching that value by early 2023\n\nThis would give them a 42 P/E and a 34.5 forward P/E, still well below historical averages for the company\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2w2kcxc0lt81.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54e750191ab126c102cfec2dd7343be17b644d1\n\n15-20% Y/Y growth is reasonable for the next 5 years assuming they manage to keep and/or expand their current market share\n\nAfter Q3, PYPL does not need to deal with eBay slowing their top line revenue growth, so Y/Y numbers will look much better. A 28 P/E is virtually unheard of for a company growing at 20% per year, so I could see a huge bull run happen in Paypal stock starting after Q3 earnings\n\nI personally love Paypal\u2019s products and use them on an almost daily basis. Paypal has shown that it can seamlessly integrate itself with businesses, and, as the world continues to digitalize, it is bound to share in that growth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\n2 1/20 2023 $100C, 2 6/16 2023 $100 C and selling 0.12-0.15 delta OTM weekly calls \n\nBy selling those options, I should be able to cover my full cost basis and reduce downside risk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nPYPL has crashed hard and should be valued higher. Buy leaps to profit big\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pt9xxjcwzkt81.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=80bdd672743157beb2c454eab1e740d9fcbdf45a", "id": "u3ut61", "created_utc": 1649980264.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "I used to work there in engineering.
