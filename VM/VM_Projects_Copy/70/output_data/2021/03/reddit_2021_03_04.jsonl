People think this is going to add substantial long term revenue streams.  That's exceedingly unlikely, because eventually everyone will offer that.  And then the incremental cost to the consumer goes down very quickly and adds little long term value.  There will be a time limited window during which Tesla will be able to derive significant revenue from that.\n\nThat's just one example.\n\nTesla's margin on vehicles hovers around 1%.  Less than that if you factor in the warranty work they try to squirrel out of.  If you assume 30+% unit growth in vehicle sales annually for the next decade, *and* increasing margins, they are *still* dramatically overpriced, today.\n\nIf they sell 10m cars annually, in 10 years time, and margins are at 3%, they will have $18B in gross profit.  And just for reference, global annual vehicle sales are around 65-70m, annually.\n\nApple's gross profit last year was $115B.\n\nThere's literally 10 years worth of *perfect* execution already in the stock price.  Tesla would have a P/E of 30 TEN YEARS from now, at *today's* same market cap, if they do everything *perfectly* and you see that kind of insane growth.\n\nAnd the only thing I really needed to look at to realize that it was *never going to happen* was how long it takes to build and make operational a car factory.  Tesla can't open enough factories quickly enough to meet that growth target, even *if* there were no competition and demand was there.  And that's also not at all a realistic assumption.\n\nThere's one thing that would prop up this valuation: if Musk rolls SpaceX into an umbrella company for a sweetheart deal for Tesla shareholders.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not seeing anywhere in the 10-k that shows how the vehicles margin is around 1%.

Honestly, when this was at $900, I kept telling people they'd be lucky if Tesla was still at $900 in 2030, much less the $10,000 price targets people kept telling me it was going to.\n\nLoads of comparisons to Amazon, of course, but Amazon never had highly negative free cash flow, and their incremental COGS are better.  People constantly tell me \"Tesla is a tech company\".  Except tech companies generally can sell a lot of tech without having something as expensive and hard to produce as a car attached to it.  FSD doesn't give you anything without a car attached to it.  Nor does the battery tech.  It's all an extremely capital intensive business, and I think that the pie-in-the-sky optimists tend to want to totally overlook that fact.\n\nTesla's stock is loaded to the tits with a bunch of clowns that can't do any financial analysis on their own, and just believe whatever shit Wall St. analysts with their own agenda tell them.\n\nAnyways, I was still early on my short, since my average is somewhere around $710.

That's the issue. The market has more than recovered the crash that happened from exactly one year ago (!) when COVID first began.  But the country is still largely closed and still nowhere close to returning to pre-COVID full normalcy, which I don't think will happen until 2024-2025. What we're seeing now is a major correction, correction for the fact that the stock market was at an all-time high despite very little progress being made in the crisis that caused it to crash in the first place.

{"title": "Ryan Cohen and Michael Burry are both invested in another stock that will benefit from a high rate environment", "selftext": "This post has a 99% chance of getting deleted so I'm not gonna waste my time posting a huge DD here. If it survives I'll edit it with all the DD you can stand, but otherwise just click on my profile an look for my WFC (Wells Fargo) DD. Here's the TL;DR  \n\n\n1.) WFC is a bank that was in the doghouse. Fed says it can come out and play now.  \n2.) WFC is a bank and banks do well in high interest rate environments. Rates are skyrocketing right now.\n\n3.) WFC is one of the only big banks that hasn't reached it's pre-pandemic highs, meaning it still has room to run.\n\n4.) When Ryan Cohen sold his stake in Chewy he invested it into just two stocks, AAPL and WFC. You could buy AAPL, but that's a tech stock that isn't going to do as well in a high interest rate & high inflation environment as a bank.\n\n5.) Michael Burry initiated a large position (3.3% of his fund) in WFC last quarter. You all know what happened last time Burry and Cohen agreed on stock.\n\n6.) WFC has really freakin' cheap options. June 45c (that's about 22% out of the money) were going for 80 cents today. IF WFC gets to $50 by June (about 34% gain) those calls would be worth $5 intrinsically. That's over 500% gains on the calls, I'm sure you can do the math if it goes higher.  \n\n\nPositions - 60 June 50c, 15 June 45c, 20 March 40c, 10 March 42.5c, 150 Shares.", "id": "lxxnws", "created_utc": 1614898250.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "Fucking delete this so I can be rich", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, it's still up almost an hour later!\n\nMods must be sleep.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Your right, I'll edit with more DD when I get home", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "i'll take it", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34887760877609253}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34786665439605713}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12282780557870865}, {"body": "I'm sure it will be gone in less than 10 minutes.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Adding to my paper trade account.
